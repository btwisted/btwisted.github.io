<em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2</em> was 'meh'. And yes, meh is on the official rating scale from now on!

Unlike the freshness and zaniness of the first <a href="http://amzn.to/2rgHN43">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> movie, this sequel (like Avengers 2: Age of Ultron) offered a lot of bang with very little plot. The character development seemed forced in some places. It's almost as if the director, James Gunn, didn't quite know where he was going with the story. But he managed to hit on specific beats, such as identifying Star Lord’s father, teasing Adam Warlock, and introducing the original Guardians of the Galaxy with Sylvester Stallone.

Although gimmicky and filled with a ton of one-liners, the cinematography and lush color-plates were fantastic. Too bad visuals and throw-away catch-phrases don't make a great story. I didn't hate this movie, but it felt contrived in a way that was familiar. It felt more like a Disney movie than a Marvel movie.

Now that I've covered the non-spoilers, let's get down to the knitty-gritty and talk about what happened in the film.

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>[SPOILERS]</strong></span>

The film is primarily green screen. Much like the green screen Star Wars prequels, it seemed the only things not CG were the costumes. Though visually stunning, some of the space scenes and battles were hard to follow.

Some of the motivations work, particularly <a href="http://amzn.to/2rhfWkb">Rocket Raccoon</a>, the catalyst setting events into motion. Rocket stole batteries from the gold Sovereign folks after he was specifically told not to (a dick move Rocket!). His actions nearly got all of the Guardians killed.

Queue in Kurt Russell as Ego, the living planet, riding on top of a spacecraft with no space suit. Ego as Peter Quill's father was the worst kept secret since Benedict Cumberbatch being Dr. Strange. This plot twist left me very underwhelmed. I thought Ego being Star-Lord’s father seemed wonky, especially him being a villain because he gave Star-Lord’s mother brain cancer. Ego’s motivation was contrived. And in typical Marvel fashion, they kill him in the end. Marvel has a tendency to kill off villains too quickly. They should have saved Ego for further exploration.

The shining jewel of the movie is Karen Gillian's performance as Nebula. She played her role with a viciousness and vulnerability few actors could pull off. With this character, she seems to be shrugging off her role as a Doctor Who companion.

<a href="http://amzn.to/2qkVU8w">Baby Groot</a> was adorable. So dang sweet it gave me a toothache! Marvel is going to sell a butt-load of baby Groot toys! Drax has some funny lines as well. His having no filter and taking everything literally had great comedic effect.

The movie could have focused more on the Infinity Stones, discussed Thanos, or perhaps introduced one of the versions of Captain Marvel.

Overall, I enjoyed watching this movie, and recommend seeing it even though I didn’t love it.  It's definitely worth a watch, and if you have kids they will love it. Tell me what you think, even if you think I’m dead wrong.
