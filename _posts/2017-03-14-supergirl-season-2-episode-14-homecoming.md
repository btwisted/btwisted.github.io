</strong>Mon-El (Chris Woods) wakes up the next morning in Kara’s (Melissa Benoist) bed; she has gotten up earlier and comes back with flowers and coffee. (What a gentlewomanly thing to do.) She asks him not to tell anyone he and she have started dating yet. When they walk into the DEO, Mon-El happily tells everyone he and Kara are dating. Cadmus is back at it. Supergirl and Hank (David Harewood) go to investigate. Cadmus shoots at them. A truck trailer contains Jeremiah Danvers (Dean Cain). Hank and Kara are able to rescue him.

Jeremiah receives a hero’s welcome back at the DEO. Alex (Chyler Leigh) is beside herself with joy. It is a wonderful reunion for the Danvers. Mon-El wonders aloud why Cadmus was sloppy enough to let them know they were on the move, especially with their prized prisoner Jeremiah in the truck trailer. Everyone wants Mon-El to shut-up.  Jeremiah tells the DEO that Cadmus has a nuclear bomb made from the heat vision Kara made when Cadmus had captured her.

Eliza Danvers (Helen Slater) arrives to see her missing husband. Mon-El is still suspicious and gives his concerns to Kara. She dismisses them and invites him to a family dinner to welcome Jeremiah home. Maggie (Floriana Lima) arrives, along with Mon-El and Hank. Everyone is having a great time at dinner, Jeremiah approves of Maggie and Alex’s relationship, and Alex and Kara act like happy kids with their Dad again. Jeremiah asks Hank if he can rejoin DEO as an agent. Hank is glad to have him back. Mon-El can’t let the happy moment continue because he can’t believe Jeremiah’s rescue, and he expresses his suspicions again. Alex and Kara are furious with him and Kara asks him to leave. Jeremiah suspiciously tells Mon-El he knows who he is and he knows Kara won’t like it. (This is the first real indication that Mon-El is up to something. If Jeremiah were on the up and up, why wouldn’t he share this information with Kara instead of threatening to expose Mon-El with it?)

Winn (Jeremy Jordan) and Mon-El are at their favorite alien watering hole. He expresses his concerns with him. Since Winn isn’t a family member or a friend of Jeremiah’s, he is willing to listen to Mon-El’s concerns. Winn promises to keep an eye on Jeremiah if Mon-El does him a favor, treat Kara right. Winn’s girlfriend Lyra (Tamzin Merchant) shows up. Back at DEO, Jeremiah is alone in the mainframe room. Winn spots him there. Mon-El and Winn report to Kara that Jeremiah broke into the mainframe. Kara questions Jeremiah about this in front of Alex and Hank. Jeremiah says he did it to look at old case files to check on his girls. Winn looks at his IPAD and agrees that is what it looks like he was doing. Alex is furious at Mon-El and Winn, and especially at Kara for not believing in their dad.

Alex and Kara are still fighting about Jeremiah. Alex accuses Kara of going along with her boyfriend instead of supporting her family. Mon-El asks Winn for relationship advice since he is getting along so well with Lyra. He advises Mon-El to listen and give Kara the support she needs. A little later, Winn is able to track down the nuclear bomb Cadmus has. Kara, Alex and a DEO team go to retrieve it. When they get to the location, there is no bomb. Jeremiah slips out of the control room, Hank notices him slipping out. Hank finds him back at the mainframe; he realizes he cannot read his mind. They begin to fight and we find out Jeremiah has a robotic arm. Jeremiah is able to defeat Hank and the DEO agents. He knocks out Winn and downloads info from the mainframe and escapes.

Winn was able to put a tracker on Jeremiah before he escaped so Alex and Kara are able to track him down. Lillian Luthor (Brenda Strong) and Cyborg Superman (David Harewood) blow up a train track so Supergirl has to leave them to save the oncoming train. Alex is alone with them as they attempt to escape. She catches up with her father. She asks him why he betrayed them; he says he did it for her and Kara. She can’t shoot him so he escapes too.  Supergirl is able to save the train, so something went right.

Kara is worried what Jeremiah’s betrayal means for everyone. Shaken up by Jeremiah’s betrayal, Alex is drinking alone. Luckily, Maggie comes by, she doesn’t know what had happened but she can tell Alex is shattered. She gets Alex to tell her what happened and comforts her. Kara is as shaken up as Alex. She is curled up on her couch when Mon-El comes by to check on her. He asks her what she needs and for once, he just listens. Kara wants him to stay with her. Back at the DEO Winn informs them of the bad news; Jeremiah stole the National Alien Registry.

Since season 1, the Kara and Alex has been trying to rescue their father.  Hank, Kara, and Alex are too close to the situation to see his rescue looked suspicious. Mon-El doesn’t have a personal connection to Jeremiah so he could sense this was wrong. Since no one except Winn would listen to him, Jeremiah was able to complete his mission. Kara was a little bit more willing to listen to Mon-El and Winn, but Alex wouldn’t hear any of it. Jeremiah’s betrayal has gutted her the most. We’ll see in the next episode how much it affects her. The show has been at its best when it has involved Cadmus. With heightened stakes, both personal and global, it makes for great story telling. It was nice seeing Mon-El not just being a lovable goof but an intelligent member of the team. Chyler Leigh was great in this episode and she brought so much emotional intensity to her performance.
