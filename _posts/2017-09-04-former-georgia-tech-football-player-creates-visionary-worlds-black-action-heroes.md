Keith Jett (FKA Gary Keith Brown II) has launched a new comic book series entitled Legends of War.  Since leaving Georgia Tech, Keith has put all his energy into bringing diversity to the comic book action hero genre as a creator, artist, and writer.  He speaks heavily on the need for diversity in cartoons, comic books, and film. He states, “In order to make an impact there must first be a difference in the way we think about and represent our culture.  We don’t need to follow what most people consider main stream.  We must create our own brands within society. ”

Keith has put his talents to work as both a creator of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BKO1YSbA5Di/?taken-by=legendsofwar">comic books </a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BVLpRsUF4et/?taken-by=gangstaturtles">Rapper Look-Alike Events</a>.

Legends of War: Issue#1 Battlefield is a story about two Black men, Jerrald and Relic, who co-exist between the Human realm and the Legend realm.  They must sacrifice their friendship and fight to the death to determine who will Die Human or Die a Legend.  The Human Realm is where those who used to be Legends go after they’ve died in combat.  They no longer have the power to activate their legend state.

The Legend Realm is where legends fight each other to become a True Legend.  A True Legend is granted unlimited power and remains in the legend state, never to be human again.   True Legends can exist in both the Human Realm and the Legend Realm.  They walk the universe as one of the most powerful beings.

The Rapper Look-a-Like Events are based on rappers that inspired Keith Jett’s art in the Gangsta Turtles series. Picture a world of Turtles... But stuck to the G-Code! Follow the intense and action packed adventures of Terrance, Krill, and KJ as these three use their G-Code to tote guns, dodge bullets and fight to bring back peace to their community from the machines who hunt them... THE CYBER BEAST UNIT. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BVySIJwlnfj/?taken-by=gangstaturtles">Tupac Shakur</a> inspired the look and personality of the character <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BVLR9dlFOB6/?taken-by=gangstaturtles">Two-Shots</a> who represents loyalty.  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWQ7xtqhCWK/?taken-by=gangstaturtles">Biggie Smalls </a>inspired the character <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWOUcVnlbPA/?taken-by=gangstaturtles">Bullet Fretts’</a> demeanor and body type.  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSZiOGthE0L/?taken-by=gangstaturtles">Boosie</a> inspired the swag and clothing of the main character, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRy6bt_h1bu/?taken-by=gangstaturtles">Terrence</a>.

<strong>Keith Jett’s Vision</strong>
