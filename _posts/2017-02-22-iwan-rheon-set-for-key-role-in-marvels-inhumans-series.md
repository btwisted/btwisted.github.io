Prominent actor Iwan Rheon (“Game of Thrones”) has been cast in the lead role of Maximus in the “Marvel’s Inhumans” television series. “Marvel’s Inhumans” will explore the never-before-told epic adventure of Black Bolt and the royal family. In the series, Maximus is a clever and charming Inhuman that is fiercely devoted to the people of Attilan, especially his brother, the King – although he harbors an intense desire to wear the crown himself . . .
