From YouTube

Marvel Comics asked Ta-Nehisi Coates, The Atlantic national correspondent and National Book Award winner, to write a storyline for Black Panther. In Coates' story, Black Panther confronts a dramatic upheaval in Wakanda that will make leading the African nation tougher than ever before! With no one left to trust, T'Challa leans the only people he can trust: Luke Cage, Misty Knight, and Storm. But Wakanda may be too far gone for this all-new, all different CREW.

Continuing the excitement surrounding Marvel’s celebrated Super Hero T’Challa, the Black Panther, the latest episode of this revolutionary multi-artist hip-hop-inspired video series samples a brand new track, “No Fear” by Jeff N Fess.
