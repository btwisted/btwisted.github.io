<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6031" src="http://nayahscifi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Powerless-250x141.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="141" />Did you catch <em>Powerless</em> on NBC? It stars Vanessa Hudgens as Emily Locke the new Director of Research &amp; Development for Wayne Security, a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises owned by Bruce Wayne. If you don’t know who Bruce Wayne is, you should stop reading this immediately and wonder what you have done with your life.

Alan Tudyk plays her boss Van Wayne, Bruce Wayne’s idiot cousin. Danny Pudi from <em>Community</em> is the chief product developer. They produce products to protect powerless people from damages caused by superhero and supervillain fights. Their division is scheduled to close if they don’t produce a new product. Van wants his division to close so he can leave Charm City and go back to corporate headquarters in Gotham. Emily is able to rally the troops and they come up with a new product to save their jobs. This is the first sitcom developed and produced by DC. Maybe they should have had Greg Berlanti produce this because he might be the only one at DC who knows how to develop a show. This show wasn’t funny. Its characters weren’t developed, the few special effects were dreadful and it was boring. It wants to be <em>Better Off Ted</em>, but instead it is just another generic sitcom with superheroes. A sitcom about superheroes is a great idea; <em>Powerless</em> just isn’t it.
<h3>CW Berlantiverse</h3>
<strong>Supergirl / “</strong>We Can Be Heroes”

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6032" src="http://nayahscifi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Supergirl-250x141.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="141" />Livewire (Brit Morgan) is in her cell with the prison psychiatrist. She rants about getting revenge on Supergirl. A prison guard and another woman break her out. Winn (Jeremy Jordan) has convinced James Olsen (Mehcad Brooks) to tell Kara (Melissa Benoist) he is Guardian. He tries to suggest to Kara that she has someone who has her back against Livewire, Kara responds she has Mon-El (Chris Wood). James isn’t too happy about that. Later in a fight in a garage, Kara and Mon-El are fighting the people who broke Livewire out of jail, but now they have her powers. Kara assigns Mon-El to protect the cops who are in the garage; instead, Mon-El goes to help Kara. Guardian shows up to protect the cops but is knocked out. Kara find out he is James.

Kara is mad at James and Winn for keeping their vigilante work from her, and at Mon-El for not protecting the cops. Kara wants him to stop, or she’ll stop him herself. James asks what right she has to stop him, and he dares her to try. Kara argues with Mon-El and asks why he helps her. Does he like her? He inconvincibly denies he does. Livewire is with an evil scientist but she is his captive. The DEO looks at the footage of the breakout and realize it wasn’t a breakout but a kidnapping. Winn figures out how to find her and calls James. They’ll go to rescue her without Kara’s help. With his super hearing, Mon-El hears the call and decides to crash in on their party.

Both Mon-El and Guardian arrive to rescue Livewire; instead of rescuing her they bicker. They are too busy bickering to notice the evil scientist has siphoned some of her power for himself. He captures James and Mon-El and plans to turn them into electric freaks like he did the other two. Winn informs Kara what is happening so she arrives to rescue all of them. Livewire joins Kara, Mon-El and Guardian to fight the electric freaks. After defeating them Livewire wants to kill the evil scientist. Kara persuades her not to kill him and allows her to escape. Kara can catch her another time. Back at DEO Kara tells James and Winn she will not stop them from their vigilante work but she can’t support them because she’s afraid they will get hurt. Later at her apartment, Mon-El tells her she was right, he remembers their kiss a few episodes ago and he does like her. Kara is silent, so Mon-El figures she doesn’t feel the same. He awkwardly leaves.

M’gann (Sharon Leal) is in her cell in the DEO. She sees a White Martian and collapses. She is dying and only Hank (David Harewood) can help her. He doesn’t want to because she’s a White Martian. (Racist) Alex (Chyler Leigh) convinces him to do a Martian mind meld to help her. Inside M’gann’s mind, Hank finds himself back on Mars. M’gann had killed fellow White Martians because they wanted her to kill a Green Martian child. Hank sees she is good and forgives her for her peoples crimes. (How green of him) M’gann is better; Hank releases her from DEO custody. What had made her ill was a psychic attack from her people, the White Martians know where she is and they are coming for her.

<strong>The Flash</strong> / “Dead or Alive”

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6033" src="http://nayahscifi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Flash-250x141.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="141" />Flash and Kid Flash work together in a car chase with some gunrunners. They combine their speed to crash the gunrunners and save some cheerleaders. The cheerleaders want to thank Wally. Wally (Keiynan Lonsdale) is living the dream. Iris (Candice Patton) wants to pursue the gunrunners’ story. Barry (Grant Gustin) would rather she not. It’s dangerous and he’s worried she’ll get hurt. She tells Barry she won’t pursue the story but goes behind his back to ask Wally to assist her. Wally asks his sister why this story is so important. Iris might only have months to live; she wants to be remembered for more than being a daughter, sister, or girlfriend; but also for being a reporter. Iris and Wally track the gunrunners to a warehouse. Iris sends Wally to do surveillance; she walks in and goes though some boxes. The gunrunner catches her and points a gun at her. Iris fearlessly walks up to the gunrunner until the gun is against her. The gunrunner is confused by her action. Wally speeds in and knocks him out. Joe (Jesse L. Martin) is furious at both of them for messing up a police investigation and Iris being reckless. Barry speaks to Iris in private to find out what she was thinking. Iris in an emotional moment tells him she is worried she won’t leave anything behind like her mother. Barry assures her that her mother left behind a brave son and the woman he loves. (In the last episode, we didn’t see the news of her impending death affecting Iris that much, but in this episode, we see how it’s affecting her. Candice Patton does a nice job with her material.)

A bounty hunter or ‘collector’ from Earth 19 named Gypsy (Jessica Camacho) has located HR (Tom Cavanagh). She is here to bring him back to Earth 19 for violating the interdimensional travel ban. The penalty for violating the ban is death. (Don’t give Trump any ideas.) Gypsy also has vibe powers like Cisco (Carlos Valdes), but her usage is more advanced. Gypsy is pretty and a badass so of course Cisco starts flirting with her.

When Gypsy shows up to take HR, Cisco challenges her to trial by combat. Gypsy accepts but warns him trial by combat is to the death. She gives him 24 hours before she collects HR. Cisco plans to spend his possibly last 24 hours practicing his vibe powers. His friends try to encourage him but they are sure he’s a dead man. Cisco’s training sequence is very funny. New team member Julian (Tom Felton) is the voice of doom and gloom. He had earlier told Barry that even with his training, at the rate his speed is increasing; he won’t be fast enough to rescue Iris from Savitar. HR convinces Barry to help him capture Gypsy. Their plan backfires. Gypsy captures HR and tells Barry that if Cisco doesn’t show up within 24 hours, she is taking HR back to Earth 19. Cisco is upset Barry didn’t believe in him. Barry admits that Iris possibly dying in four months has him out of sorts. Julian comes in with something useful. When Gypsy is preparing to use her vibe powers, she gets a little bit off balance; it might be something Cisco can use to his advantage.

The duel begins; Gypsy is winning but Cisco is able to hang in there. Then they do some cool jumping to other dimensions. They jump to Earth 2, then to CatCo in Supergirl’s world, and then to a volcanic wasteland. Turned on by this action, Gypsy flirts with Cisco. They vibe back to our world. Gypsy prepares to vibe Cisco and gets a little off balance, Cisco strikes with a vibe attack and wins. Julian is shocked Cisco won.

Of course, Cisco doesn’t kill Gypsy. She won’t take HR back, but she can’t let her superiors know she failed. She will tell them she killed HR. HR can never go back home. She and Cisco flirt some more and nearly kiss but instead she vibes back home with an ample supply of coffee. (The had a blight on Earth 19 that destroyed their coffee crop) HR thanks Cisco. In an earlier conversation, HR explained why he came to Earth 1 knowing it was a capital offense. Even though he was successful and famous on Earth 19, he knew he was a fraud and wanted a new start. Cisco volunteered to defend him because he felt he owed a debt to the other Harrison Well’s in his life. Now Cisco says it balances out the times the Wells’ helped him. It’s what you do for friends. Working there at Star Labs, they invest in each other, one day HR might save him.

In the final scene, Wally is training. His speed is increasing at a faster rate than Barry’s. Barry tells Wally he has been approaching this the wrong way. He won’t be able to get fast enough to save Iris; but Wally can. (Even though Iris death is approaching instead of this being a gloomy episode, it was a lot of fun. They were still able to show the seriousness of the situation but do it in a fun and exciting way.)

<strong>DC’s Legends of Tomorrow</strong> / “The Legion of Doom”

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6034" src="http://nayahscifi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Legends-of-Tomorrow-250x141.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="141" />The intro is different this week. Instead of one of the Legends doing the intro, it is the members of the Legion of Doom. This week, this is their story. Damien Darhk (Neil McDonough) and Eobard Thawne (Matt Letscher) recruit Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman) on the date the Green Arrow kills Damien. Malcolm is watching Merlyn’s death on TV. Back to the present, Malcolm is going to use hypnosis to get the information about the Spear of Destiny’s location from Rip. Rip’s brain was reconfigured so he can’t remember he is Rip Hunter (Arthur Darvill) and he doesn’t know anything about the Spear of Destiny. Since he has no memory, Malcolm’s plan fails, so Damien goes back to the first plan, more torture. He rips off one of Rip’s teeth and finds a barcode to a bank in Switzerland from 2025. Eobard sends them along with Rip to the bank to get the contents of the safety deposit box. Damien and Malcolm are at each other’s throat but Rip observes this is what Eobard wants so they decide to work together against Eobard. They trap him in the bank’s vault and get him to tell them why he needs them and why he is always running off. We’ll get to that.

The Legends are also busy trying to get the medallion to work. Martin (Victor Garber) and Jax (Franz Drameh) go back to Central City to meet up with Martin’s daughter, Lily. To help them figure out how to decode the medallion, they bring Lily (Christina Brucato) aboard the Waverider. Everyone except Sarah (Caity Lotz) is surprised Martin has a daughter. Once he explains that Lily is a time aberration, they promise not to tell her. Of course, Mick (Dominic Purcell) lets it slip so Martin has to explain it to Lily. She is upset with her father, she feels like he doesn’t want her. Jax goes to Martin and tells him he needs to tell Lily he loves her. Martin’s father never told him he loved him and that’s one of the reasons he never wanted kids, he was afraid he’d be like his father. Martin and Lily talk, he tells her it’s true he didn’t want kids but being on the Waverider has taught him that time gives you what you need. They reconcile. Meanwhile the crew is trying to figure out whom Eobard is. There aren’t any records of him. Martin remembers that Eddie Thawne had committed suicide so Eobard would never come into existence. That’s why he needs the Spear of Destiny; he needs to undo his removal from existence. (Martin was in the episode when Eddie committed suicide.)

Back in the bank vault, Eobard is trying to stay a step ahead of the Black Flash, the late Hunter Zolomon. He can sense Eobard using the speed force. Malcolm and Damien will help him but he has to treat them as full partners. He agrees to their terms. Eobard will have to stay still and not use the speed force. The Black Flash shows up but can’t sense Eobard since he isn’t moving. Damien and Malcolm trap the Black Flash in the bank vault. The contents in the safety deposit box are Rip’s memories. They give them back to him with some adjustments. Now we are in New Jersey in 1776 and Rip is preparing to shoot George Washington. (Fun episode, it doesn’t take itself that seriously and that works for this show.)

<strong>Arrow</strong> / “Second Chances”

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6035" src="http://nayahscifi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Arrow-250x141.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="141" />It is three years ago in Central City and an undercover cop named Tina Boland (Juliana Harkavy) is being tortured by some thugs. They bring in her partner (and lover) and kill him in front of her. While she is screaming, the Star Labs incident happens and she gets a sonic scream. Back in present time, Team Arrow is looking for a replacement for Laura on the team. Oliver (Stephen Amell) doesn’t like anyone the team picks. Curtis (Echo Kellum) has heard about an urban legend. They click on a video of Tina, she is kicking ass. They also realize she has a sonic scream. The mystery woman is in Hub City so Oliver, Curtis and Rene (Rick Gonzalez) go to meet her. Once there they ask Tina to join their team, she rudely refuses. They are able to track her down to her hideout. Her wall is covered with the pictures of the thugs she is hunting down. On top is Sean Sonus (Steve Bacic), the drug dealer she was investigating who tortured her and killed her partner. She uses her sonic scream to kill a thug. They now decide the best way to find Tina is to find Sonus. Rene and Curtis discuss going after this woman and decide their group is about giving them and others second chances. They locate Sonus, so does Tina; to her and Team Arrow’s surprise, he has a metahuman power too. He is able disorientate them with a sonic look. Oliver meets up with Tina again, this time without his mask. He explains why they are there. The team will help her and then leave. They catch Sonus and members of his gang on a rooftop making a big drug deal. They rush in for a major fight. After defeating the gang, Tina has a gun on Sonus. Oliver tries talking Tina out of killing Sonus, he doesn’t succeed.

Before Oliver and the boys (minus Rory [Joe Dinicol]) left for Hub City, the DA Adrian Chase (Josh Segarra) tells Oliver the NSA was investing General Walker. Walker was able to use his influence to stop the investigation. Their files on the case have gone missing. The missing files could clear Diggle (David Ramsey). Felicity (Emily Brett Rickards) makes it her mission to find this missing file. Felicity hacks into the NSA. She can’t find them there so she goes into the dark net using her old hacktivist handle, “Ghost Fox Goddess”. Someone contacts her about the missing file. They want to meet her in person. Felicity meets the contact; it is an admirer from her hacktivist days. She gives her Diggle’s file along with other files from the NSA hoping they will get Felicity back to hacktivism.

When Oliver gets back to Star City, Felicity has good news, they have evidence to clear Diggle. Oliver and Chase deliver the good news to John, he is a free man. (Yea!) Felicity is looking at the other files and gets a look in her eyes, could “Ghost Fox Goddess” be returning? Tina drops by the Mayor’s office. Killing Sonus didn’t make her feel better. She would like to join the team. Tina reveals this is her undercover name, her real name is Dinah Drake. Welcome Black Canary to the team.

Flashback: Oliver is rescued by Talia al Ghul (Lexia Doig), Nyssa’s half-sister. She helps him get to an ally of Kovar. Oliver kills him of course. Talia knows all about Oliver, from the boat sinking, the island, Hong Kong and now Russia. She asks why he won’t go home. Instead of all the side missions he has been on he should be dealing with the evil people in his father’s journal. Oliver thinks he’s a monster. Talia has a way for him to be Oliver Green again; by making the monster become something else, she presents him a green suit (from season one).

I would usually discuss <em>The Young Pope</em> here but I’m behind due to the Super Bowl. The two episodes I saw were great, especially episode five. If the new episodes equal it in quality <em>The Young Pope </em>could be in the Emmy race. What I plan on doing is a season review at the end of the season to give the show the proper attention it deserves.
