The first day of training was a great success. The university students were bright and eager. I was worried because I was about to train these French speakers in English. A few speak English well, but the majority of students do not have strong English speaking skills (but their English proficiency was far superior to my French proficiency!). Fortunately, Christelle, my teaching partner from MobileSenegal, was there to interpret when students did not understand me.

We began the class with an introduction to the program. I first discussed the areas the trainer is responsible for teaching: Facebook, Google Maps, Google tablets and apps, presentation delivery, collaboration, and critical thinking. We then stopped and did a team building exercise. After the exercise, we continued the program introduction with a discussion on appropriate social media behavior. Next we talked about the main duties of the mentors, which are to help students become proficient with course topics and show students how to apply what they learn.

We broke for lunch and ate a great Senegalese rice dish. Christelle and I had a chance to get to know the students better. The students and I struggled to understand each other, but somehow we were able to have a good conversation. They are a great group of young people!

After lunch, we distributed Google tablets and asked the students to familiarize themselves with the device. At that point we discovered how absolutely horrible the wi-fi connection is at the university. As a result we were not able to review all the tablet features. However, we asked the students to find a better Internet connection after class and review the tablet and download the apps that we suggested

<strong>Putting words into action
</strong>We wanted the university students to put our morning lecture into action. They would experience what and how we wanted them to teach the middle school students. The afternoon was devoted to Facebook. But before we started the Facebook exercise, we asked the students to come up with the official name of the training program. They had to brainstorm and decide on a name. After minutes of evaluating different name possibilities, they decided on <a title="Oussouye Connect on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/oussouyeconnect" target="_blank">Oussouye Connect</a>.

We then moved on to work on Facebook. The class abandoned wi-fi and decided to connect to the Internet through Ethernet cables. That connection isnâ€™t great either, but a better alternative to wi-fi.

We asked students to work in groups and collaborate to create the page. They divided themselves into three groups to create the logo, cover page, and written content. The students successfully collaborated and designed a beautiful Facebook page for the <a title="Oussouye Connect" href="http://nayahsolutions.org/projects/oussouye-connect/" target="_blank">Oussouye Connect</a> program. We will use this page as the central means of communication for all activities with the middle school students.

We wanted the students to create a presentation to convey how they plan to teach Facebook to the middle schools students. But we ran out of time and will start the next day of training with this exercise.
