In the year 3000 in Detroit, evil Rip Hunter (Arthur Darvill) meets up with Charles McNider/Dr. Mid-Nite (Kwesi Ameyaw) to collect, the piece of the Spear of Destiny Rip had given him to hide many years ago. Dr. Mid-Nite doesn’t realize Rip is evil until it is too late. Rip brutally kills him and not only take his piece of the Spear of Destiny but also steals tech from 3000.

The Legends arrive too late, Amaya (Maisie Richardson-Sellers) is heartbroken to see her old friend dead. They next head to Camelot to retrieve the other piece. As an historian, Nate (Nick Zano) keeps telling them Camelot won’t look the way it is presented in modern media. Ray, (Brandon Routh) a big Camelot enthusiast can’t wait to see it. When they arrive, it looks just like the way books and movies have portrayed it.  They find out that Courtney Whitmore/Stargirl (Sarah Grey) is there disguised as Merlin. She is the one who shaped Camelot into what we see. Years earlier Rip had given different members of the Justice Society of America pieces of the Spear of Destiny and dropped them off in different parts of history to prevent anyone finding a whole spear. Evil Rip uses his knowledge to track the pieces down.

Evil Rip and Damien Darhk (Neal McDonough) break up the festivities and kidnap King Arthur. They use the tech Evil Rip stole in 3000 to mind control Arthur and many of his knights. Ray read the stories of Camelot as a kid, and wants to join them to fight Rip and Damien. Guinevere knights Ray and he becomes Sir Raymond of the Palms, Arthurian knight. He ends up fighting Damien in a sword fight. Ray wins the sword fight but Damien cheats and shoots him. Luckily, Ray has his Atom suit on and it protects him from the gunshot. The Legends help Guinevere and her knights defeat Rip, and his mind controlled minions. Mick (Dominic) and Martin (Victor Garber) figure out how to defeat the futuristic mind control device Rip has, turning the tide in the battle. Sara kisses Guinevere, and since her last name is Lance, we get the legend of Sir Lancelot. Damien deserts Evil Rip and the Legends capture him this time and keep him.

Back in the Waverider, they have Rip in the brig. Jax (Franz Drameh) warns Rip not to try anything. They don’t realize that Rip can still communicate with Gideon (voice of Amy Pemberton).

Arthur Darvill makes a great villain and it’s always good to have Neal McDonough to stop by. It was clever the way they presented the Camelot legend. Someone like Ray would be a Camelot fan boy, he wants be a hero so bad. Of course, Sara would start the legend of Guinevere and Lancelot. She can’t keep from kissing a pretty girl. Oh Sara you homewrecker. Amaya expresses most viewers’ feelings that Sara letting Rip get away at the end of the last episode was a bad idea. You have to put personal feelings aside when you have to face the threat they are facing. Rip is going to give the Legends more problems the next episode. This was a fun and silly episode.
