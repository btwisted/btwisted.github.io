Marvel Comics asked Ta-Nehisi Coates, The Atlantic national correspondent and National Book Award winner, to write a storyline for Black Panther. In this episode, the combined fury of T'Challa, Shuri, Manifold and the Hatut Zeraze rains down upon Tetu and Zenzi's rebellion. But will there be anything left of Wakanda to rule? The critically acclaimed storyline comes to an end and leaves behind a startling new status quo.

Continuing the excitement surrounding Marvel’s celebrated Super Hero T’Challa, the Black Panther, the latest episode of this revolutionary multi-artist hip-hop-inspired video series samples a track from Lil B.
