Nayah Sci Fi believes science fiction can be a great motivator for students of all ages to embrace studies in science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM).

Science fiction is written or visual content that explores real or imagined future scientific or technological advances and major social or environmental changes, frequently portraying space or time travel and life on other planets. A myriad of science fiction genres exist, such as science fantasy, post-apocalyptic, superhero, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction">many more</a>.

Science fiction plots usually embrace scientific and technological concepts. Often readers or viewers are inspired to research those concepts to understand the story better. Some embrace the artistic aspects of science fiction and learn how to write powerful storylines or draw science fiction characters like superheros. As a result, you can find professionals, such as scientists, engineers, writers, graphic artists, give credit to science fiction as a major influence in their career choices.

We decided it would be great to give those professionals a platform to share how science fiction inspired them, and in turn, inspire today's students to embrace science fiction as a fun medium, that not only entertains, but educates too.

Our first in the series features John Jennings, <a href="http://creativewriting.ucr.edu/people/Jennings/index.html">professor</a> of Media and Cultural Studies at the University of California, award-winning <a href="http://amzn.to/2FK0owJ">graphic novelis</a>t and author, and co founder of <a href="http://sfmlkday.org/bcafcon/">Black and Brown Comic Arts Festival</a>.
