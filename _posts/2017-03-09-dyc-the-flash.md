<strong><img class="alignleft wp-image-6933 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahscifi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flash_attack_gorillacity-250x129.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="129" /></strong>Barry (Grant Gustin), Caitlin (Candice Patton), Cisco (Carlos Valdes), and Julian (Tom Felton) dressed in his Indiana Jones outfit, travel to Earth 2 to rescue Harry (Tom Cavanagh) from Gorilla City after receiving news from Jesse Quick (Violett Beane) of her father’s capture. Quickly captured by the Gorillas, Barry and Cisco’s powers are negated by their cells. Grodd (voiced by David Sobolov) speaks to the group through Harry. He asks their help to stop the leader of Gorilla City, Solvar (voiced by Keith David) from invading Earth 1’s Central City. (No one bothers to ask why Solvar would want to invade Earth 1’s Central City when he can invade his own Central City.) Barry has to defeat Solvar in the arena in a battle to the death. In Gorilla City, it is kill or be killed. (Kind of like our capital now.) Barry defeats Solvar but will not kill him. Grodd is now the leader of Gorilla City, and being Grodd, he of course double-crosses Barry. He, not Solvar, planned to invade Earth 1’s Central City and he needs Cisco to use his vibe power to open a portal to take Grodd and his army to Earth 1. Barry’s crew is able to pull a fast one over on Grodd and everyone including Harry is able to escape. Grodd is always thinking one-step ahead and has an alternative plan; he has captured Gypsy (Jessica Camacho) and will have her open a portal for him.

Barry left Jesse and Wally (Keiynan Lonsdale) to protect Central City in his absence. Jesse is surprised Wally is a speedster and upset he hasn’t contacted her. They are having trouble communicating but HR (Tom Cavanagh) gives them some relationship advice. After they smooth everything out, Jesse wants to stay on Earth 1 with Wally but she does not know how to tell her father. She will get that chance when Barry returns with him.

It is Valentines’ Day and Barry has cooked Iris (Candice Patton) a big breakfast. HR has decorated Star Lab for Friend Day, Earth 19’s version of Valentines’ Day. Harrison thinks HR is a Moran. Everyone is happy because the group thinks they have stopped the Gorilla invasion they saw in the future. Jesse tell her father she is moving to Earth 1 to be with Wally, Harrison shows no apparent emotion and tells Jesse if she is happy, he is happy. (No one can really believe that.) Gypsy shows up and attacks Cisco and Barry, Harrison shoots her. Gypsy wakes up confused in her cell. She had been on Earth 2 to pick up a fugitive and Grodd captured her. He took control of her and sent her to kill Cisco and Barry. They realize the only way he could still be controlling her is Grodd and his army are already on Earth 1.

Cisco tries to convince Gypsy to fight with them. While under Grodd’s control, Gypsy saw his plan, it entailed pain and destruction. She wants to leave. Harrison and Wally adjust Cisco’s equipment so he can see into the future and spot where Grodd is going to attack. Harrison tells Wally he is dying but don’t tell Jesse. Cisco sees the location where Grodd will attack so the Central City police mobilize there. (Where is US military?) Grodd gains control of Joe (Jesse L. Martin) and has Joe shoot himself. The Flash is able to move Joe out of the bullets path. They realize this is just a distraction. Elsewhere Grodd commandeers General McNally (Paul Jarrett).

Barry plans to kill Grodd. Iris doesn’t want him to do this. She doesn’t want the weight of killing Grodd on Barry, she is afraid it will compromise his humanity. (Barry wants to kill Grodd to stop the invasion, changing one of the future events that lead to Iris’ death.) Wally tells Jesse it is a bad idea for her to stay on Earth 1; she should spend as much time with her father as she can. Jesse asks what he is talking about and confronts her father for his obvious lie. Harrison has created a device to put on Joe to get Grodd’s memories. Joe draws a picture of a general. General McNally is under Grodd’s control and he is the commander of a base with nuclear missiles.

Harrison advises Barry not to kill Grodd. Once you go down that road, it is easier to do the next bad thing. The gang is able to locate the missiles Grodd is going to fire on Central City. Barry uses his super speed to hit the numbers on a key pad until he hits the numbers to stop the launch.

(We see a glimpse of Earth 19’s version of the Flash.) Jesse, Wally, and Barry are on the street to face the Gorilla army. The speedsters engage the Gorillas, but aren’t successful in stopping them. Cisco and Gypsy appear with Solvar. They brought him to fight Grodd for control of the Gorilla army. The two giant gorillas fight and Solvar gets the best of Grodd. Barry convinces Solvar not to kill Grodd but to leave him on Earth 1 as an ARGUS prisoner.

Our heroes have won again and learned a valuable lesson about finding another way instead of murder. Since they never learn any of the other lessons they learn each week, I’m sure Barry is going to kill someone very soon. Gypsy kisses Cisco passionately and goes back to Earth 19. Harrison warns Wally to be good to his daughter. He reminds Barry there is always another way. Harrison might be talking about solving life’s problems. Back at their apartment full of flowers, Barry proposes to Iris. Wally and Jesse are on the couch watching a movie and preparing to make out when Jesse wants a Belly Burger. (It seems like the wrong time to want a burger.) Wally runs out to get her one when he gets a vision of Savitar.
