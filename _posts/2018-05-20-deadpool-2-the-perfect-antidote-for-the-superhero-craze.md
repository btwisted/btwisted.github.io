<p class="p1">Raunchy, bizarre with buckets of blood, cussing galore, and slap stick violence—Deadpool 2 was the perfect antidote for the superhero craze.  My dark little heart, that’s two sizes too small, loved it!</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike more serious fare (ahem, Avengers Infinity War I’m looking at you!} I enjoyed this movie, like a fat kid loves cake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m biased.</p>
<p class="p1">Ryan Reynolds and director David Leitch created a tour de force in the sequel to Marvel’s infamous and uber popular "merc with a mouth", <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(film)">Deadpool</a>. Ryan Reynolds inhabits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool">Wade Wilson</a> much like Robert Downey Jr. inhabits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man">Tony Stark</a>. He commits to the make-up and character. I could never see anyone else playing Deadpool.</p>
<p class="p1">Usually a sequel is never as good as the original, yet there is that rare movie; NO not a movie, a film, that rockets past its original and fulfills the promise of the narrative and source material at the same time! DC and Warner Bros. should be taking notes. As a matter of fact Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) has several sick burns for the DC Cinematic Universe and everybody else. I’m going to try hard not to spoil the movie, but there might be some <span style="font-size: 20px; color: #0000ff;">spoilers ahead</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">None of Deadpool’s deadly sharp tongue was left out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ryan Reynolds and company left no jokes or F’s on the cutting room floor. The opening credits made me laugh so hard. Right then I knew I was in for a very different movie. They were about to do the damn thang, with all the schlock and antihero anyone could ask for, and then some!</p>
<p class="p1">The beginning was a little bumpy. Most of the comedic action shtick in the trailers happened in the beginning. But the REAL Deadpool 2 began when Wade Wilson killed a boat-load of people that affected his blissful love life with Vanessa, played by Morena Baccarin, who delivered a stellar performance,</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_%26_Deadpool">Cable and Deadpool</a> played a game or reckless cat and mouse with psychotic abandon that would make Tom and Jerry proud.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_(comics)"> Domino</a>, played by Zazie Beetz, stole every scene where she appeared. The examples of her powers were really fun to watch on screen. Peter, the everyman with no superpowers, is the internet's spirit animal and MVP. And let's not forget <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Force">X-Force</a> and my favorite X-Force character, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanisher">The Vanishe</a>r.</p>
Deadpool 2 contains a bunch of terrific cameo appearances, and used nostalgia and marketing in a amazingly climatic way. I’m laughing just thinking about it. There are going to be a lot of catch phrases and meme’s pouring out on the internet.

If you loved the first movie, you will thoroughly love Deadpool 2.
