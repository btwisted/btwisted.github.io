<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Since we’ve been fortunate enough to get Doctor Who back in 2005, Russell T Davies and Steven Moffat have given us the gift of annual Christmas specials. This year is no exception, we have <i>The Return of Doctor Mysterio</i> to look forward to. It’ll be the first time Doctor Who has entered the superhero genre; even though you could say Doctor Who is one of the greatest superheroes of all time. So let me be the ghost of Christmas past and take you back to the previous Christmas specials. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>The Christmas Invasion</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4871" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2005-200x141.jpeg" alt="2005" width="200" height="141" />At the end of season one, the ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) regenerates into the tenth doctor (David Tennant). <i>The Christmas Invasion</i> introduces Nine to Rose’s family and the audience. Even though it’s introducing the new doctor to us, he’s absent for most of the episode. It’s really about Rose carrying on in the Doctor’s absence and trying to figure out if this new guy is actually her Doctor. We meet a great villain race in the Sycorax, and see our old friend Harriet Jones, who is now Prime Minister. We know Harriet, we know. After the Doctor wakes up from his post-regeneration snooze, we find out he’s still our beloved Doctor— maybe a brighter person on the surface, but not one to give second chances. The Sycorax leader finds this out the hard way, and Harriet Jones does too after she has Torchwood destroy the fleeing Sycorax warship. A great episode that had nice Christmas touches like the robotic Santa Clauses and whirling Christmas tree.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>The Runaway Bride</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4869" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2006-188x141.jpeg" alt="2006" width="188" height="141" />After the sad traumatic end of <i>Doomsday</i>,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>The Runaway Bride </i>introduces future companion Donna Noble. One moment Donna is walking down the aisle, the next she materializes in the TARDIS. After initially sparring with each other, they team up to take on the Empress of Racnoss, a giant spider like alien who plans on turning earth into a buffet, with us on the menu. The first time I watched this episode, I didn’t like it that much. I didn’t know how to take Donna. She is such a loud and belligerent person. She softens as the episode goes on but I really didn’t like her. It wasn’t until she joined the show in Season 4 that I absolutely fell in love with her and the episode. After falling in love with Donna that season, I could see what she was doing in the special, and I really grew to appreciate it. This was a small women seeing how big the universe is and growing as a person to meet it. She’s quite funny in the episode, and Catherine Tate and David Tennant have great chemistry together. We are reintroduced to the robotic Santa Clauses in a delightful TARDIS/car chase and another whirling Christmas tree with exploding decorations. That just screams Christmas.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>Voyage of the Damned</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4868" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2007-100x141.jpeg" alt="2007" width="100" height="141" />Season three ended with Martha Jones choosing herself over being the Doctor’s rebound companion, leaving Nine alone again. Just as he’s ready to sulk, the Titanic crashes into the TARDIS. But not the Titanic with Leo and Kate. This Titanic is a space luxury cruiser and it’s orbiting Earth to celebrate Christmas. <i>Voyage of the Damned</i> guest star was Kylie Minogue as Astrid, a waitress who wanted to be amongst the stars. She’s very cute and bubbly, so of course she had to have a sad and noble death. Hanging out with the Doctor isn’t for the faint of heart. She would have made a great companion, but Kylie Minogue is an international pop star, so that wasn’t going to happen. It was a good episode but not really a stand out. The best part was when they went to London and found it deserted because of all of the other incidents that had happened on Earth during Christmas the last few years. We did get to meet Wilf (Wilfred), Donna’s wonderful grandfather.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>The</i> <i>Next Doctor</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4866" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2008-188x141.jpeg" alt="2008" width="188" height="141" />This Christmas special finds the Doctor devastated and alone. Even though he had defeated the Daleks with the aid of his united Nu-Who companions, he paid a heavy price for the victory. To save Donna he had to wipe her mind of his existence and her time with him. This woman who had grown into being the woman who saved the universe was now back to being the Donna Noble we met in <i>The Runaway Bride</i>. It was completely heartbreaking, and it took a toll on the Doctor. So he’s alone and runs into a man in Victorian England who tells him he’s the Doctor. Later we find out he is Jackson Lake, a man who suffered a great tragedy courtesy of the Cybermen. They are there to use the poor children of London to build a huge ‘Cyber-King’. The Doctor defeats them in a hot air balloon. He reunites Lake with his son and even agrees to join them for Christmas dinner. It’s Christmas time in Victorian England, and one thing movies and television have taught me, you can’t get more Christmassy than that. I did enjoy the human villain, Miss Hartigan. It’s great when she strolls up to the funeral in her red dress and tells off the proper English gentlemen about their hypocritical behavior before having the Cybermen kill them. Considering, the type of men they were, maybe she wasn’t the real villain after all. (She was though.)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>The End of Time</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4865" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2009-188x141.jpeg" alt="2009" width="188" height="141" />We are at the end of the David Tennant/Russell T Davies Doctor Who era. <i>The End of Time</i> is their swan song, and they went all out for it. We got nearly everyone who had played a major part in Nu-Who up to this time, along with the return of the Time Lords. Led by Rassilon (James Bond himself, Timothy Dalton), the Time Lords are total dicks. They make you even feel sorry for the Master. I’ll skip over the plot since it was very convoluted. To be brief, the Master turns nearly everyone on Earth into himself. The Time Lords show up and prove themselves to be dicks. The Doctor shoots the white-point star (don’t ask), and after defeating the Time Lords he sacrifices himself to save Wilf.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To reward himself before he regenerates he goes on a farewell tour to see his old companions one last time. He gets aboard the TARDIS and as he’s regenerating tearfully says, “I don’t want to go”. Of course he’s not actually going anywhere because he regenerates into the eleventh Doctor, (Matt Smith). You can probably sense this isn’t my favorite Christmas special. You must be psychic. It was too long, it was convoluted; but mostly it felt less a Doctor Who story and more a bow for Tennant and Davies leaving the series. They deserve all the phrase for their contributions to the show— Tennant being a fun and popular Doctor, and Davies bringing the series back from the dead. It just felt like that was all this episode was about, celebrating their era, not about telling a great story. What was the episode’s connection to Christmas? It was around late December. The story could have taken place anytime in the year.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>A Christmas Carol</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4863" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2010-189x141.jpeg" alt="2010" width="189" height="141" />This is the first Christmas special of the Matt Smith/Steven Moffat era. Amy and Rory are on their honeymoon aboard a space liner. It gets caught in an electrified cloud. The Doctor goes to the planet to get the man who controls the atmosphere, Kazran Sardick (Michael Gambon of Harry Potter fame) to let the space liner land. Being a Scrooge like dick he won’t let it land, condemning Amy, Rory, and the rest of the passengers and crew to perish. The Doctor goes back in Kazran’s past and starts changing it to make him a better person. He and young Kazran become pals and meet a young woman named Abigail who was released from a cryogenic chamber for her beautiful singing that can calm down the sharks who live in the clouds. Not quite like the original Christmas Carol. As Kazran grows into a young man, he and Abigail fall in love. They can only be together around Christmas time when she’s released from her cryogenic chamber. One of the reasons she is in the chamber is because she’s dying from an incurable disease. As he grows older, he becomes bitter over her fate; he is becoming the man the Doctor was trying to prevent him from becoming. The Doctor goes back to introduce young Kazran to old Kazran, who behaves as horribly as his father. Old Kazran draws his hand to strike young Kazran and realizes he’s become his father. That changes him. Kazran allows the space liner to land. Old Kazran and Abigail spend her last Christmas together. It was a wonderful story, full of wonder and romance. Of course it had a Christmas theme being it was a variation of the Christmas Carol. This story couldn’t have taken place any other time but Christmas. Plus, it had a flying shark!! One of my favorites of the Christmas specials.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4862" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2011-250x125.jpeg" alt="2011" width="250" height="125" />The Doctor falls out of the sky, a nice British woman helps him back to his TARDIS. Three years later during World War II, her husband goes missing over Europe. Close to Christmas, she and her two children evacuate London for an estate in the English countryside. The Doctor is disguised as the estate’s caretaker. They go on an adventure and eventually guide her husband back to his family with the light of a mother’s love. Oh,I hated <i>The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe</i>. It brought out the Grinch in me. The mother was too twee and sweet for my taste; she wasn’t even a widow as it turned out. Her kids were non-descript. Their adventure on the winter planet with the trees was an ecological message shaped as a sledgehammer. The humor was sophomoric; and the Doctor was annoying. It was as if the Doctor had too much sugar and caffeine in his system. It bored me to tears. The only part I liked was at the end when the Doctor hopped in the TARDIS and went to visit Amy and Rory for Christmas. He hadn’t seen them in quite a while, and it was a touching reunion. So if you haven’t seen this episode before, just watch the last few minutes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>The Snowmen</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4860" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2012-200x141.jpeg" alt="2012" width="200" height="141" />It seems as often is the case on this show, the Christmas special is the first episode of the show we see after something tragic had happened at the end of the previous season. Season seven was divided into two parts, the first with Amy and Rory; the second with Clara Oswald. The end of part one was Amy and Rory being sent back in time by the Weeping Angels in Manhattan. After that incident, the Doctor went into a deep depression and isolated himself from the world, parking the TARDIS in the clouds above Victorian London. The only people he associates with are Madame Vastra, Jenny and Strax. He meets a pretty barmaid named Clara who notices something strange with the Snowmen. The Doctor is intrigued by her. Clara is also a governess and learns the kids under her charge are in danger. She goes to Madame Vastra for help in contacting the Doctor. She’s given a test, when she says “pond” the Doctor springs to action. The Doctor is up against the Great Intelligence. He defeats the Great Intelligence with the help of his friends but loses Clara. Before he can fall back into his depressed state, he realizes that Clara Oswald is the same person as Clara Oswin, a Dalek he met at the beginning of the season in “Asylum of the Daleks”. The Doctor’s enthusiasm is renewed as he jumps in the TARDIS to find the Impossible Girl. <i>The Snowmen</i> is a nice rebound after the disaster of the previous Christmas special. As we learned earlier, nothing is more Christmassy than Victorian England. We meet the Victorian version of Clara, and I quite like her. She’s intelligent, brave, adventurous, has a sense of humor, and is a cute young woman, all of the qualities the Doctor looks for in a companion. The Great Intelligence along with his human proxy, Doctor Simeon were great villains. Strax was a great comic foil. I loved the scene when he keeps forgetting to put on gloves for the worms that make you forget if you touch them. I really enjoyed this episode and it along with “Asylum of the Daleks” was a great introduction to Clara.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>The Time of the Doctor</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4859" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2013-108x141.jpeg" alt="2013" width="108" height="141" />Doctor Who’s first episode was in November,1963. So 2013 was the 50</span><span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s1"> anniversary of the show. <i>The Time of the Doctor</i> was the Christmas special that year. What also elevated this special was that it would be Matt Smith’s final episode as the Doctor. A message through all time and space comes from a town named Christmas on the planet of Trenzalore, which we had learned back in <i>The Name of the Doctor</i> would be the planet he would die in. The Doctor and Clara find out the message is coming from the Time Lords. Quick reminder, in <i>The Day of the Doctor</i>, instead of destroying Gallifrey, all thirteen of the Doctors froze Gallifrey in a moment of time. So now the Time Lords still exist. The enemies of the Time Lords know this too and are try to prevent them from coming back. The Doctor fights these enemies (down to just the Daleks by the end) with the help of the Christmas villagers for hundreds of years until the Doctor is an old man on the brink of death. The Doctor had tricked Clara earlier to send her back to earth. She was able to come back in the TARDIS to say goodbye to him. In a crack in the universe, (a callback to Season 5) she begs the Time Lords to give him a new cycle of regenerations. Ask and ye shall receive; because they send it to him. Beginning his new regeneration, he has enough energy to destroy the Daleks. After saying goodbye to a hallucination of his beloved Amy Pond, he drops the bowtie and becomes the twelfth Doctor. This was a satisfying way to say goodbye to Matt Smith. I was especially touched when Amy showed up. There were many callbacks to characters and themes during the Matt Smith era, but it didn’t overwhelm the episode. A good way to end the 50</span><span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s1"> anniversary and make way for Peter Capaldi.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>Last Christmas</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4858" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2014-250x141.jpeg" alt="2014" width="250" height="141" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Clara and the Doctor had a tough go this season. It took her a while to get use to the new Doctor. He was older and not as friendly and lovable as eleven. Even twelve wondered if he was a good man. Clara also met a fellow teacher at her school, Danny Pink. They fell in love, but unlike Amy and Rory, Danny never became a part of the TARDIS crew. Clara kept lying to Danny to hide her adventures with the Doctor. So Danny had no reason to like twelve, and of course twelve didn’t like him, since when has the Doctor liked to share. Unfortunately, Danny died in an accident and Clara was racked with guilt. By the end of <i>Death in Heaven </i>Clara lies to the Doctor and tells him Danny has been brought back from the Nethersphere and the Doctor tells her he has found Gallifrey, but the coordinates Missy gave him led to empty space. Who could bring these two together again, why old jolly St. Nick himself. In <i>Last Christmas</i> dream crabs have trapped Clara, the Doctor and other people in a dream state. They think they are at a North Pole lab. Eventually the Doctor works out that everyone is in this dream state. They are able to wake up, dreaming that Santa is flying them back to their homes on his sled. The Doctor removes Clara’s crab and discovers he and Clara haven’t seen each other in over 60 years and she’s a very old lady. They celebrate Christmas together until the Doctor sees Santa. He realizes he’s still dreaming. After he wakes up he finds Clara to be her young self again. Realizing how much they missed each other, Clara rejoins the Doctor in the TARDIS. This was another satisfying episode. Usually the Doctor and his companion get on like gangbusters from the very beginning. Twelve and Clara had to work at their friendship, so seeing them after all the trials and tribulations they went through become real friends was gratifying. Having Santa Claus in Doctor Who was a great idea and Nick Frost was a great Santa. A Santa for our times. My favorite scene was watching the Doctor drive Santa’s sled.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>The Husbands of River Song</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4857" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/river-250x127.jpeg" alt="river" width="250" height="127" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We are finally at the last special, <i>The Husbands of River Song</i>. Hey I think you’ve heard this one before, the Doctor has lost his companion and is sad and alone again. Jeanna Coleman (Clara) had left at the end of the season. So as her run ends, Clara is in a limbo state between life and death traveling in her own TARDIS accompanied by Arya Stark. The Doctor is in the future when he’s recruited to help River Song steal a diamond from a king. River doesn’t recognize the Doctor’s new face, so he gets to observe her when she isn’t with him. River’s quite the player and rogue. River is finally captured, they want the Doctor and they know she is someone he cares about. River laughs at this, even though she loves the Doctor, she doesn’t for a moment believe he loves her. So imagine when the stranger next to her says, “Hello sweetie”. River realizes the Doctor does love her and is there for her. They escape and crash on Darillium. Going way back to Nine, we learn that before she dies, she will spend the most romantic night of her life with the Doctor at a restaurant on Darillium where the wind goes between these two mountains and sings. The Doctor had been holding off going there, but now they are there. It’s all very sad until the Doctor tells her a night in Darillium lasts 24 years. I loved this episode, it was funny and very romantic. I liked Alex Kingston with Matt Smith, they had a nice chemistry together. Still it felt very Mrs. Robinson. With her and Peter Capaldi together, there was real sexual chemistry. Now you had two grown ass people together. That 24 years in Darillium must have been pretty hot. I enjoyed the caper River had and liked all the other side characters. Even though underneath the story there were melancholy notes, as it often is during the holidays, this was a bright and happy episode. It was nice seeing the doctor happy for a change.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Generally, speaking I have enjoyed the Christmas specials. Quite a few of them I really loved. If you’ve missed some of them, Amazon has all the specials except “The Husbands of River Song” on prime. If you don’t have Amazon Prime, BBC America will be showing the episodes throughout the week. Check your local listings. So I’ll see you after Christmas with a recap of “The Return of Doctor Mysterio”. Merry Christmas, have a Happy New Year and may this holiday season be joyful.</span></p>
