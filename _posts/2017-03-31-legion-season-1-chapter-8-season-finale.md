The Interrogator (Hamish Linklater) from Chapter 1 is in the hospital. We flashback to scenes from Chapter 1 where he is interrogating David (Dan Stevens). It turns out our Interrogator has a name, Clark, and he has a husband, Daniel (Keir O’Donnell) and a son. They are constantly by his side at the hospital. When he gets home, his family tries to get back to normal, but the pain of third degree burns over 40% of his body don’t quite let him. There are more flashbacks of David’s escape from Division III. His agency wants to assign him to desk duty but he won’t accept it. He needs to avenge the men who lost their lives in the pool ambush. He later gets a sweet ass cane from his locker that has a wolf head on it. Now we pick back up to where we left off in the last episode. The Division III troops have our mutants surrounded. Clark tells David they have to talk and orders his men to shoot everyone else. David calmly waves his hand and the Division III troops are piled up upon each other. David, “Now we can talk.” Clark, “Shit.”

Clark is taken to a room. His cane is transmitting everything that is happening to headquarters. They decide to watch events before attacking. David is off by himself and Syd (Rachel Keller) joins him. She jokes that he is going to broker a peace before dinner. She wants him to take care of himself first. David says when you are schizophrenic you have to be careful that the life you think you are living isn’t a lie. He meets this girl who has friends who tells him he isn’t crazy but has powers and you want to believe it but fear it might be an illusion. He had been in Clockwork for six years doing nothing, contributing nothing, but now he is ready to take action. As David walks away Syd flashes to the white room. Something is under the sheets. Back in the real world she hears a dog bark and children laughing. She might be hearing King and David’s childhood.

In the conference room, the mutants are on a war footing. Ptonomy (Jeremie Harris) wants to shoot Clark. Syd is against this. Cary (Bill Irwin) is working on David’s halo, the device that is keeping the Shadow King at bay. David wants to talk peace. Kerry (Amber Midthunder) is in the other room with Clark, keeping an eye on him. Cary walks in with a glass of water for Clark. Kerry is still mad at Cary for leaving her when they were in the hospital. Clark is amused by their disagreement. Melanie (Jean Smart) is thinking about earlier when she invited Oliver (Jemaine Clement) to dinner. She is still hurt that Oliver can’t remember her. Melanie enters the room to talk to Clark. He is making threats, telling her Division III will be there soon with an army. Melanie might have 50 people in her group, he works for a branch of the US military in conjunction with international bodies, all lined up against her small group. Melanie grins and tells him that he was right about David, he is a world-breaker. If they had taken care of David when they first had him; when he didn’t know who he actually was, she would take his threats seriously. Now if they try to attack them, he should remember that the world of the dinosaurs are over. She and Clark go outside where David is levitating. David tells Clark, “War is over. If you want it.”

Cary is boosting the power of the halo. David keeps repeating to Clark, “You don’t have to be afraid.” This annoys Clark and he shoots back at David, “You're Gods, one day you will wake up and realize you don’t have to listen to us.” David responds that is the way of the world and people learn to talk to each other. Syd finds herself back in the white room and Lenny (Aubrey Plaza) emerges from under the sheet. Lenny looks worse for wear. Syd is still connected to her, even if David isn’t at the moment. She wants Syd to help her escape, she’ll even leave David’s body. Syd tells her a story about her mother’s battle with cancer and how they took a tumor out and put it in a bag and burned it. Lenny promises Syd if she doesn’t help her escape she will kill David. Back in the conference room Syd tells Clark everything about David’s battle with the parasite to Melanie’s displeasure.

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7446" src="http://nayahscifi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Legion_david_headconnected_ch8-250x141.png" alt="" width="250" height="141" />David is set up in a makeshift operating room. Oliver is adjusting the controls. Syd asks what they are going to do. Cary explains they will isolate Amahl Farouk, the Shadow King’s brain waves from David’s. Once they are able to do that they will suck out Farouk and leave David intact. Pink Floyd’s “Speak To Me/Breathe” plays on the soundtrack. David begins in his most recent memories and starts going backwards. Anytime we see an image of Farouk, no matter what form he took, it is erased. We keep going backwards in David’s life until we reach him as an infant. David confronts Farouk in his form as Lenny. He compares Lenny to a phantom limb. David wonders, “What am I without you?” Lenny responds that she isn’t leaving him and begins to strangle him. On the operating table, David’s nose starts to bleed. Farouk is keeping his promise to Syd.

She sprints from the conference room to the operating room. Clark can see the monitor of David’s operation and so can Division III. They see the image of the Devil with the Yellow Eyes. The commanding officer at Division III orders to get Equinox. When Syd gets in the room she kisses David on the lips; that allows Farouk to jump into Syd’s body. Her eyes turn yellow. Kerry runs into the room and Syd touches her allowing Farouk to gain control of Kerry. She kicks Cary in the ribs. Ptonomy runs in with his machine gun but Kerry grabs hold of him and they shoot up the room before she tosses him into a wall. She points her fingers at Melanie like a gun and air shoots her. Oliver is trying to increase the power. He suddenly remembers Melanie and smiles. Clark hits Kerry with his cane and she tosses him into a wall. David appears and they rush each other, David in a ball of blue energy, Kerry in a ball of red energy, they collide and Farouk jumps into Oliver’s body. While everyone is out, Oliver/Farouk get into a car and Oliver sings to himself “If I Ruled the World” as he drives away.

David wakes up, he helps up Kerry and then Clark. He tells Clark he knows they have to work together and Clark agrees, he’ll talk to his people. Kerry helps up Cary and they make up. David checks on Melanie and finally helps Syd up. He tells her she shouldn’t have done that, but she had to save him. She asks if they won, he jokes does it look like it. She asks how he feels, he tells her he feels better. Cary wonders where Farouk is and Melanie enters the room and asks has anyone seen Oliver. Oliver is driving down the road and Lenny appears looking nice in spring like dress. Oliver asks, “Where do we go?” Lenny turns on the car radio to T-Rex “Children of the Revolution” and says, “Somewhere warm.” After the credits roll we get a post-credit scene; Syd and David are on a balcony. He senses that Oliver and Farouk are heading south. A small sphere shows up and sucks David in it.

I wasn’t paying attention to the end credits and I hadn’t turned the station because I was listening to “Children of the Revolution” so it was a lucky break I didn’t miss it. I wasn’t expecting that. It typified the season for me, the show’s creators doing something I didn’t expect but enjoying it. David is finally rid of Farouk but before he can even catch his breath, he is a captive of something else. I’m glad they didn’t destroy Lenny; that means we would have lost Aubrey Plaza who has been a big surprise to me. I liked her on “Parks and Rec” but I didn’t know she had this type of performance in her. I will be glad to see her next season with Jemaine Clement as her partner in crime.

The opening sequence with Clark recuperating from his burns was brilliant. It is great when a show can show the humanity of one of its villains. In Clark’s mind he is the hero of this show, one man fighting a band of mutants who might destroy the world. I’m curious how he and David will work together in the future. I feel sorry for Melanie losing Oliver again. Will she blame Syd for this? Syd was more than happy to put everyone else in danger to save her man. That makes Syd a little dangerous when you think about it. This episode wasn’t as flashy as the other episodes but the storytelling was very smart and satisfying. They tied up the major storylines from this season and set up some great ones for next season.
