Sci Fi &amp; Fantasy Author <a href="http://www.writeonrighton.com/index.html"><strong>Zig Zag Claybourne</strong> </a>writes stories that are quite frankly, "chicken soup" for the dark part of humanity's soul. His narratives boldly examine the nature of mankind, and the probable outcomes of our societal failings. His latest masterpiece,<strong><em> '<a href="http://amzn.to/2sCbJrO">The Brothers Jetstream Leviathan</a>'</em> </strong>is an action packed thriller, that bears witness to the fire and slick cool it will take for the heroes to defeat a lord of propaganda, and a false prophet to those that are woefully ignorant. He does all of this in a captivating, parable-driven writing style, that is unlike anything you have ever experienced before. <strong>'<em>The Brothers Jetstream' </em></strong>is a ride you will never forget, but it doesn't end there. Zig Zag is in the process of writing another novel to add to the saga!

We're keeping our fingers crossed here at Nayah Sci Fi, in hopes that Zig can meet his self proposed deadline. We all could use a well crafted distraction from the holiday stress! In the meantime, do pick up your copy of <em><strong>'<a href="http://amzn.to/2sCbJrO">The Brothers Jetstream Leviathan</a>'. </strong></em>You will not be disappointed!
