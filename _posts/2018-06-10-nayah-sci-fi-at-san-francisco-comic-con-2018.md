Nayah Sci Fi has had a blast covering  <a href="https://sanfrancomiccon.com/">San Francisco Comic Con (SFCC) 2018</a>. This year the event is happening in Oakland, California at the <a href="http://www.oaklandconventioncenter.com/">Oakland Convention Center</a>. Why Oakland, not San Francisco?

In the video below,  <a href="https://twitter.com/SF_ComicCon">Jamie Kautzmann</a>, PR Coordinator for SFCC 2018, talks to us about the location change, as well as what's new and what she's most proud of this year.
