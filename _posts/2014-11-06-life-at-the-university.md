I really enjoy engaging with students. Most of my students are freshmen. Mere babies. But they are so committed to their education. Some students travel in cramped vehicles two hours each way just to go to class. They work very hard and listen intently. They make my stay here worthwhile, especially when I'm complaining about the hot, HUMID weather, slow internet, and general lack of western creature comforts. Many students visit me during my office hours to practice speaking English. I learn so many things from them, such as the history of Zanzibar, politics, culture, and so on.

They are well-versed in American history, particularly African-American history. When I mentioned I was born in Mississippi, they were shocked and began saying that if I could make it out of Mississippi and be successful, they can too. I find that funny because most Mississippians would freak out to know that 'third' world Africans consider Mississippi as America's 'third' world state. Life is indeed interesting. Most of my students were literally heartbroken about the mid-term elections and its affect on 'uncle' Obama.  They wanted to know why there was so much opposition to him and why his agenda is seriously weakened. So I spent most of my day explaining the three branches of government and the impending conflicts with Obama and the legislative branch. It's hard to see the faces of disillusioned youth. But I encouraged them to focus on building their country and start making their own products and services to lessen their dependence on the west.
