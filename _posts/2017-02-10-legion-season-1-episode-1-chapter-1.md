A montage of David Haller (Dan Stevens) beginning with him as an infant, toddler, a young happy boy, an increasingly troubled teen, to a disturbed, suicidal adult scored to <em>Happy Jack</em> by The Who. We hear voices all around him as he puts the noose around his neck. Now we are at the Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital. His sister Amy Haller (Katie Aselton) is visiting him for his birthday. She has brought him a chocolate cupcake with one lighted candle on it, but she cannot give it to him. On the walls of the visiting room are posters in different languages and strange people in the corners. Amy’s clothes, purse, and hairstyle is reminiscent of the 60s but this isn’t a period piece. David seems to be in relatively good spirits even though he’s been here for 260 weeks. (5 years) Amy is a little uneasy, she wants to make this a nice day for him but it can’t be that great since he’s in a mental hospital.

David is sitting in the lobby with his pal Lenny Busker (Audrey Plaza). Lenny is a motor mouth and she is commentating on the patient who is drooling. It’s one long string of saliva dripping from his mouth. It seems like just a typical day for the two. Then everything changes is a big way. A beautiful blond woman who radiates sunshine and seems to move in slow motion walks into the room. This ray of sunshine is Sydney Barrett (Rachel Keller) and she’s a new patient at the facility. Lenny approves of the new arrival; David grabs her bag of twizzlers and approaches Syd, careful there son, she doesn’t want to be touched. It’s love at first sight for David. David is in bed dreaming and in his dream are flashes of different scenes, a kitchen explodes, scenes of the hospital and a scene that is underground with a strange creature with yellow eyes all mixed together. Later in group therapy, the therapist is talking to David while Lenny listens to her tunes. Syd walks in and joins the group. She questions if they are crazy, maybe their problems aren’t in their heads, maybe they aren’t problems at all. The therapist ask her about not wanting to be touched. He tells her it’s important for people to touch so that they can connect with other people. David asks if she wants to be his girlfriend. Syd answers, “Okay, don’t touch me.” Lenny looks at both of them like they are crazy. We get a montage of their courtship in the hospital scored to <em>She’s a Rainbow</em> by The Rolling Stones. They do cute things like talk about pie and they both hold a scarf at the each end to simulate holding hands. It’s very romantic and little sad.

I was confused by this part until they started clearing it up later in the episode. David isn’t in the hospital. He’s in a new building that looks like an abandoned school. The man questioning him isn’t a psychiatrist from Clockworks; he is from an unidentified government agency. The Interrogator (Hamish Linklater) wants to know about Sydney Barrett, she has disappeared. They say she was never a patient at Clockworks. The Interrogator looks over David’s file, he was admitted to the mental hospital for trying to kill himself. They never found the rope he used, but there were burn marks on his neck. It also says he thinks he can control things with his mind. David gets upset and objects start moving, a pen flies up and cuts the Interrogator’s cheek. They decide to take a break and get David something to eat.

We flashback to the hospital, the day before Syd is to be released. She enters David’s room and lays down beside him with a pillow between them. She wants him to get better so he can be released soon too.

The building they are keeping David in has a large contingent of soldiers. The government agents know that David is a powerful mutant. One of the agents wants to kill him now. The Interrogator decides they are going to move to level two and kill him if he realizes who he is. Right now, he wants to study him. We flashback to the incident in the kitchen. David is upset and the kitchen slowly explodes around him with objects flying and circling around him. He sees the yellow-eyed demon. Back in interrogation, more men have entered the room. David realizes they are scared of him. They bring in some machines to test him. The Interrogator asks him about the incident at Clockworks.

Released from the hospital Syd is waiting to say goodbye to David. David rushes in and kisses her, both of them faint. Then really strange and horrifying things begin to happen. The hospital goes dark and red. The patients get riled up. Syd looks in the mirror and is confused. When they kissed, they switched bodies, so the person looking in the mirror isn’t Syd but David. They are rushing ‘Syd’ out the hospital. ‘David’ is screaming in confusion. Suddenly there are no doors in the building and the patients are behind the door less rooms banging on the walls screaming for freedom. Poor Lenny isn’t so lucky; she is in the wall dead.

David is trying to explain they switched bodies but he is getting agitated. He is beginning to lose control again and the room is shaking. They pipe gas into the room and he is knocked out. David dreams of his childhood. After ‘Syd’ is released from the hospital, ‘Syd’ becomes David again. He checks his boobs to make sure. It is Halloween and since his apartment was destroyed during the kitchen incident, he heads to his sister’s house. Without saying, she is surprised to see him. He asks to stay at her place a few days. She is happy to have him stay in the basement. He sees a lamp from his childhood. Lenny appears and tells him he killed her. David says it wasn’t him, but Syd. Lenny says it was still his power and there was no way for her to handle it. Lenny warns him that they are going to be after him now and they are going to kill him in a singsong voice.

David is dreaming again, it is a big Bollywood dance scene with him, Syd and the rest of the patients in Clockworks scored to <em>Pauvre Lola</em> by Serge Gainsbourg. A fun scene that should have run longer. I hope they do a big musical number every episode. When he wakes up, he is in a pool tied up in a chair with wires. The Interrogator warns him if he does anything, he’ll get 10,000 volts for his trouble. Out of the hospital, he started looking for Syd. A man and woman are following him. Suddenly Syd is in this memory talking to him. She tells him to slowly slide into the water. David’s memories are becoming clearer, he had thought he had seen the Interrogator before getting out of a car at the hospital when ‘Syd’ was released, now he realizes it was an older blond woman. David slides in the water and fighting is going on above him. Suddenly skeletons are sinking into the pool. Syd and the two people who were following him earlier are rescuing him. They get outside and there are other mutants there fighting the soldiers and winning. The soldiers are no match for the mutants. They are flying and dying all over the place. David is confused and stops to ask Syd if this is real. She tells him she loves him and it is real. Syd introduces him to the woman in the car, their leader Melanie Bird, (Jean Smart).

Due to a number of circumstances beyond my control, I only watched this episode once. With a premiere episode this dense with different time lines and an unreliable narrator, I could use another viewing or two. I was confused for much of the episode. It was only after reading my notes that it became clear to me. There is a lot going on, but it makes sense once you have an idea who is who and where they are in time and what might be taking place and what is a hallucination. I’m going to enjoy watching this episode again. Regardless, I really enjoyed this episode. The acting was top notch, especially from Dan Steven and Rachel Keller. If their performances and chemistry aren’t strong, the show isn’t grounded in anything and everything else floats away. I haven’t enjoyed Audrey Plaza this much since <em>Parks and Recreation</em>. Too bad Lenny died but I will enjoy ghost Lenny. The music was great, the songs used and the score gave the show its psychedelic feel. The show has a late 60s early 70s vibe, but it feels like it’s taking place in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. This is the way David sees the world. We can’t take for granted anything we see. I’m looking forward to more Mutant action and interactions. There are too many questions to ask. My main one is Syd, was she sent to the hospital to meet David, or was she really a patient there. She is a mutant, so I don’t believe it was a coincidence. I’m really looking forward to Jean Smart next week; she is one of those actresses who makes any project she’s in better. I’m not clear on everything on the show and I hope my review didn’t twist some things around. I guess I’m in the same boat with David, except with no powers.
