The last new episode was the Christmas special, “The Abominable Bride”. It’s been nearly three years since the third season finale “The Last Vow”. If you can remember that far back, Sherlock shot the villain Charles Magnussen to protect Mary Watson’s (Amanda Abbington) secret. Instead of being arrested and set on trial, Mycroft Holmes (Mark Gatiss) convinced the government to send Sherlock on a dangerous secret mission to Eastern Europe. Before his plane could leave British airspace Sherlock is recalled because Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) was on TV screens across Great Britain asking “Did you miss me?”

There is another government meeting between Mycroft, Lady Elizabeth Smallwood (Lindsay Duncan), some government officials and Lady Smallwood’s secretary. The meeting is about Charles Magnussen’s murder. Sherlock (Benedict “Dr. Strange” Cumberbatch) is texting and obviously not concerned about what they are planning on doing. Since they need him to deal with the Moriarty situation, the government will cover up the murder. They ask Sherlock what his plan is. Sherlock tells them it is just to wait. He isn’t certain that Moriarty is even alive.

Later on Sherlock is with Dr. John Watson (Martin Freeman) and a very pregnant Mary. Sherlock isn’t just going to wait around for Moriarty’s plan to spring into motion, he is going to work some cases. We get a montage of Sherlock working cases, insulting clients and just being his delightfully arrogant self.

Next we see the boys rushing Mary to the hospital. Mary and Watson have a baby girl.They ask Molly Hooper (Louise Brealey), Mrs. Hudson (Una Stubbs), and Sherlock to be the child’s godparents. At the christening Sherlock is busy texting again. The baby’s name is Rosamund Mary Watson, but they will be calling her Rosie. Everything up to this point has been sunny and bright.

DI Greg Lestrade (Rupert Graves) finally brings Sherlock a case that captures his fancy. A Mr. Willborough is celebrating his 50<sup>th</sup> birthday. He gets a call from his son who is supposed to be in Tibet. They have a Face Time chat; the son’s car is in the spacious driveway. Their chat gets interrupted. A week later a drunk driver’s car hits the son’s parked car. It catches on fire. After the firefighters put out the fire they find a body in the car. It’s Mr. Willborough’s son; and he’s been dead for over a week. The police are baffled so they turn to our favorite high functional sociopath.

What really interests Sherlock in the meeting with the grieving parents is the shrine they have for the late Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Even though he pretends not to know who she is, (I think he’s pretending) he notices there is something missing. The confused parents tell him there was a bust of her on the table. If you care about the case, here’s the solution. The son recorded his Face Time chat. He was actually hiding in the car to surprise his father for his birthday. The son had a seizure and died in the car that night. Why no one smelled his corpse before the drunk hit his car I don’t know.

Sherlock is still interested in the Thatcher bust. He asks Mycroft if Moriarty had any connection with Mrs. Thatcher. Sherlock is humiliating another potential client when a policewoman and Lestrade bring him another busted Thatcher bust case. I think the owner of the bust was killed and there was some blood left, possibly the killer’s.

Sherlock and the entire Watson clan (including baby Rosie) go to meet a hacker named Greg. Sherlock isn’t there for Greg but for his bloodhound Toby. Toby picks up the scent and leads Sherlock and the Watsons to a butcher shop where they are washing off the blood of animals. It’s a good way to cover your tracks; remember that the next time you commit a bloody murder. Now Sherlock uses Greg’s hacking skills to find out that six limited edition busts of Mrs. Thatcher were manufactured in a shop in Tbilisi Georgia (not near Atlanta) and sold to six people.

Sherlock goes to the home of one of the bust that’s still standing. He catches the culprit and engages in a fight with him in the family pool. Sherlock wins the fight and has the bust. He smashes it to find out what’s hidden in it. It’s a memory stick (flash drive) with the letters AGRA written on it. It’s the same initials that were written on the memory stick that Mary had back in “The Last Vow”. Instead of this case being about Moriarty, it’s about Mary and her past as a free-lance assassin. Before our killer escapes he tells Sherlock she’s a traitor and he’s going to kill her.

[caption id="attachment_5047" align="alignleft" width="212"]<img class="wp-image-5047 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AJAY-212x141.jpeg" alt="ajay" width="212" height="141" /> Ajay[/caption]

We flashback to six years ago. Mary and her team are trying to rescue the British ambassador to Georgia. The Georgian terrorists are expecting them. A major gun fight breaks out. Mary escapes but the rest of her four-person team aren’t so lucky. One of them, Ajay is able to hide his memory stick with his team’s info in a bust of Margaret Thatcher before he is captured. They torture him for info and mock him by telling him a British woman betrayed them. Ajay assumes that British woman was Mary. He is held in captivity for six years before he escapes. He’s been smashing these bust looking for his memory stick. That’s how he crossed Sherlock’s radar. Sherlock thought he was looking for the black pearl, (another Sherlock Holmes case) and was connected to Moriarty. That’s why he was so interested in it.

Sherlock speaks in private to Mary. He tells her that a former team member of hers, Ajay is alive and he’s looking to kill her to pay her back for betraying the team. Mary can’t believe that Ajay wants her dead. She didn’t betray the team. She had assumed all of them were killed in the botched mission. She asks Sherlock to open a letter and when he does he falls out. Mary had some kind of knockout drug on it. She takes the memory stick and leaves.

[caption id="attachment_5049" align="alignleft" width="250"]<img class="wp-image-5049 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/maryindisguise-250x141.jpeg" alt="maryindisguise" width="250" height="141" /> Mary in one of her disguises[/caption]

After waking up, Sherlock goes to Mycroft to get more information on AGRA. He doesn’t like using free-lance groups but he doesn’t deny using their services. Meanwhile Mary has written a letter to John. She is on a plane in disguise. She is trying to put as much distance between her and John and Rosie as possible. She is going to find Ajay and solve this problem before she comes home. She doesn't want him and Sherlock looking for her. We get a montage of Mary in different disguises traveling around the world in a haphazard way so Sherlock can’t figure out where she is. She enters a room in the middle east and hears a familiar voice talking to a young boy. She asks Sherlock how he found her. He gives her an elaborate explanation about probability until he admits he had placed a tracer on her memory stick. We find out the AGRA are the first names of the members of the group. Mary’s first name is Rosamund. She named Rosie after herself. (Rosamund Mary Watson Jr?)

[caption id="attachment_5050" align="alignleft" width="250"]<img class="wp-image-5050 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marywithgun-250x141.jpeg" alt="marywithgun" width="250" height="141" /> Mary with loaded gun[/caption]

Ajay walks into the room with a loaded gun. He figured out the best way to find Mary was to follow Sherlock. Mary tells him she didn’t betray the group. Sherlock asks him what his captors actually said about the traitor. They said a British woman betrayed them but they never said it was Mary, he just assumed it. Before they could have a heartwarming group hug the police bust in and kill Ajay. After talking to Sherlock, Mycroft has Lady Smallwood arrested. The word AMMO had been mentioned by the terrorist. That is her code name.  She had been the contact person between the government and AGRA.

While all of this was going on, John Watson was having his own little storyline. Earlier in the episode we saw John mildly flirting with a young woman. No harm it seems. Mary is back home now apologizing to John about all of her secrets and the harm it has done to their little family. John can’t completely play the innocent in all this. There was more to his little scene. The young lady had given him her digits. He was initially going to throw them away but he decides to keep them. He proceeds for a length of time to carry on a textual relationship with her behind Mary’s back. It doesn’t look like their relationship became physical, but he was having an emotional affair with this young woman. He’s ready to confess to Mary when they get a call from Sherlock.

[caption id="attachment_5052" align="alignleft" width="238"]<img class="wp-image-5052 " src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ladysmallwood-250x90.jpeg" alt="2" width="238" height="84" /> Lady Smallwood[/caption]

Mycroft is questioning Lady Smallwood about the leak to the terrorist group. She denies any involvement in it.Sherlock is observing the interrogation and seems to believe her. He starts using his big old brain and figures it out. He calls Mary and John to join him. They can’t bring the baby with them so John volunteers to stay with (junior). This whole case was about Mary anyway.

[caption id="attachment_5053" align="alignleft" width="203"]<img class="wp-image-5053 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Vivian-Norbury-203x141.jpeg" alt="vivian-norbury" width="203" height="141" /> Vivian Norbury[/caption]

The secretary we met at the beginning of the episode is at the London Aquarium amongst a lot of sharks. Her name is Vivian Norbury (Marcia Warren), and she is the British woman who called the terrorists and betrayed AGRA. Since she worked for Lady Smallwood she had access to her secrets. She decided to sell those secrets for some cash. The ambassador in Georgia had gotten wind of her activities, but before she could turn her in the embassy was overrun.

[caption id="attachment_5055" align="alignleft" width="250"]<img class="wp-image-5055 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aquarium-250x138.jpeg" alt="aquarium" width="250" height="138" /> Vivian, Sherlock, and Mary in aquarium[/caption]

She saw this as her chance to get away, so she notified the terrorists about AGRA and the ambassador was killed in the firefight. Lestrade and Mycroft show up to arrest her. All seems fine, but Sherlock couldn’t just walk away with a victory. He has to humiliate Norbury, telling her how he figured out the case and how pathetic her life is. To shut him up, she pulls out a gun and attempts to shoot him.

[caption id="attachment_5056" align="alignleft" width="235"]<img class="wp-image-5056 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/maryshot-235x141.jpeg" alt="maryshot" width="235" height="141" /> Mary takes the bullet meant for Sherlock[/caption]

Either an act of heroism or stupidity, Mary jumps in front of Sherlock and catches the bullet meant for him. John enters the room and howls in pain as she dies in his arms. He is furious at Holmes for violating his vow he made in “The Last Vow”, to protect the Watsons.

&nbsp;

Things are pretty dire, Sherlock is so broken up he goes to see a therapist. When he goes to check up on John and Rosie, Molly gives him a message from Watson, Sherlock isn’t welcomed there any longer. Mycroft sees a note on his refrigerator with the number 13. He makes a phone call. Sherlock asks Mrs. Hudson that if he is going too far to say Norbury to him. Mrs. Hudson has a disc for him, he thinks it might have something to do with Moriarty but it is from Mary. She has given Sherlock a case; to save John Watson.

What a shocking episode. I didn’t see Mary Watson dying until she jumped in front of Sherlock to save his life. I don’t think a mother of an infant should by catching a bullet for her husband’s best friend, but that’s just me I guess. It must be the secret agent assassin training kicking in. Even though the season three finale was nearly three years ago, this episode is a direct follow up to it. Mary is still pregnant when the episode began and Sherlock’s murder is being taken care of. So Sherlock literally got away with murder. This seemed to embolden him to be more reckless and haughty than usual. Maybe both Sherlock and Mary have been acting that way. Being an assassin, you’d think Mary would have kept a lower profile and would have at least thought twice about having a child. Being around a world famous detective isn’t my idea of low profile. Her past life came back to haunt her in “The Last Vow” and it did again in this episode. Earlier in the episode Mycroft told the parable of “An Appointment in Samarra” about a man trying to cheat death. He thought he could avoid it by going to Samarra, but that’s where death was waiting for him. Death was waiting for Mary and Sherlock’s actions finally bore their deadly fruit. The person who is paying for both their actions is John. He’s broken and it’s going to take a lot to get him right. Hence Mary’s request for Sherlock to save him. A better question might be who is going to save Sherlock.

Great performances by everyone especially Amanda Abbington. Even though she was married to John, she actually fit in better with Sherlock. She was the smart, wily professional who could stand her own against him. She really fitted in with the two of them and gave them a nice feminine counterpoint. The fight scene between Holmes and Ajay was shot well, even though a trained assassin should have beaten the crap out of Holmes. That reminds me of the scene with Vivian Norbury in the aquarium. You’d think that when they came to arrest a person suspected of treason that someone would have thought to bring some armed personnel with them. The minute she pulled her gun out in America an officer would have taken her out. I’d think the same would be true in Britain. Aside from those quibbles, I really enjoyed the episode. I can’t wait for next week’s episode. Toby Jones appears as Cullverton Smith. With a name like that you know he must be a nasty piece of work.
