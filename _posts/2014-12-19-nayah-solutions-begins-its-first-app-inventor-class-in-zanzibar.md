On Saturday, December 20, Nayah Solutions will conduct a seven-week train-the trainer <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">App Inventor</a> class with members of the Tanzania Youth Icon (TAYI) Community Center.

<a href="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-15-11.45.27.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4030 size-medium" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-15-11.45.27-300x224.jpg" alt="Tanzania Youth Icon (TAYI) Community Center" width="300" height="224" /></a>

TAYI engages local middle or high school dropouts to keep them off the streets with positive activities and skills that could potentially earn them a living. TAYI asks youth at the center what they want to learn. They provide a volunteer from the community to teach and coach them on the skill. The youth work hard and learn well because they have an interest in the subject.

Nayah Solutions will teach ten members of the center how to develop Android mobile apps with App Inventor. These members will teach other youth in the center who express an interest in developing mobile apps. App Inventor is a great tool to teach mobile programming without writing code. It will provide a good foundation in mobile programming to youth with limited educational skills. After the class, The State University of Zanzibar will identify members with potential to learn how to code and provide programming classes for them.

Nayah Solutions has enlisted Sabbah Mohammed, a 17-year old local high school student to help develop and teach the course. She also will translate some portions of the App Inventor tutorials in Swahilli. We hope her age and Swahilli speaking skills will connect with our target audience at the center.

We will update you on our progress throughout the seven weeks.
