In exchange for teaching communication skills to undergraduate computer science students, the university provides me with a place to stay and a driver to take me to and from campus. I live in historic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Town">Stone Town</a>. So getting to the main campus in Tungu is about a 15 minute drive.

I like living in Stone Town because it allows me to live among regular people. But it's also the main center for tourism, so I can find western creature comforts when I am in need. The people are absolutely warm, friendly, and accepting. Since 98% of the population is Muslim, I was worried about having to cover my head. I tried the first few days, but it was SO HOT. I just couldn't keep it on without feeling I was going to have heat stroke. So I decided to go without and I've had no problems. In fact, because my hair is dreadlocked, many call me 'sister rasta'. It makes me interesting and different. (So thanks Bob Marley and Whoopi Goldberg for making dreads popular. And thanks to my goddaughter's mother for being the first person I knew personally with dreads, which inspired me to do it.) Living in Stone Town is like being in the 10th century wrapped in the 21st century. Such a great mix of old and new. Many cultures have settled over the centuries and left their mark--Arabs, Africans, Indians, Portuguese, Germans, and English. And you can see all those cultures reflected in one way or the other. The streets reflect the narrow streets of centuries gone by. It's easy to get lost because Stone Town is essentially a maze of houses, businesses, hotels, and markets. If you have the money, you can find what you need. Of course this is an island on the Indian Ocean--typical humid, tropical climate, which has wreaked havoc on my poor northern California soul. Man, it's HOT here. I will write posts about the beaches and the ocean. Simply gorgeous. And I'll also share various photos from Stone Town, the university, and my students too!

Here are some photos of my living arrangement. The original plan was for me to live in a 3 bedroom. But a family of five arrived and couldn't live in the efficiency. So I was happy toÂ exchange. That family has now left and I'm trying to decide whether to stay where I am or take their place. I have so much privacy and cool breezes from the patio! I am very fortunate to have modern conveniences. So many people in the area do not.
