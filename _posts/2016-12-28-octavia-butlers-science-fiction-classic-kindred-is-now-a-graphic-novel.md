During her career she received the prestigious <a class="mw-redirect" title="Hugo award" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_award">Hugo</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Nebula award" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_award">Nebula</a> awards for her work. In 1995 she was the first science fiction writer to receive the <a class="mw-redirect" title="MacArthur Fellowship" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacArthur_Fellowship">MacArthur Fellowship</a> (also known as the <em>Genius Grant</em>). Despite pushback from science fiction writers who feel the genre must conform to one vision of science fiction, Butler created what <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/madeleine-crum">Maddie Crum </a>describes as "books with optimistic visions of the future, where communities were more diverse and accepting, and genders were regarded as fluid".

One of Butler's most recognized works is the novel, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindred-Octavia-Butler/dp/0807083690">Kindred</a></em>. It describes the journey of a young black woman who finds herself transported back in time to meet her ancestors in the antebellum south.

And that's great news. A new generation can read Kindred and enjoy it in an exciting new way.  And don't stop at Kindred.
