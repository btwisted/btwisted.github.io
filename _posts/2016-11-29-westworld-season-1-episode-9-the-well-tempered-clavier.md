<p class="p1"><span style="color: #808080;">by <a href="mailto: kbeartv61@gmail.com">Kbear!</a> on November 28, 2016</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4754" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/maeve-512x512-1-141x141.jpg" alt="maeve-512x512" width="141" height="141" />The episode opens with Maeve back in the lab, but instead of being with her usual lab rats, Felix and Sylvester, she is with Bernard. He is trying to figure out why she slashed faux Clementine’s throat. He puts her in analysis mode and asks her a series of questions. Maeve pretends to be in analysis mode and lies her ass off. He checks his pad and sees all the upgrades Maeve has had and is ready to report them. Maeve tells him, “It takes a thief to catch one” and that freezes him. She has figured out he’s a host. She tells a shocked Bernard that he’s a host. I wonder how many times he’s been shocked to find this out. I’m going with triple figures. She tells him they don’t have to live this way and that he should find out what is really going on with him.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dolores and William have been captured by Logan and his Confederate buddies. Logan has risen up to the rank of Major or maybe General, he isn’t sure. Logan is having fun taunting Dolores and William. William tells Logan that Dolores is different from the other host. He needs Logan’s help so that he can get Dolores out of the park. Logan looks at William like he’s insane and roughly grabs Dolores.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bernard is stalking around in the back of the cold storage area where they keep the decommissioned host. He has summoned Ford to meet him. Once Ford has arrived he asks Ford to take him back to his deepest memories. Ford advises him not to do it. To persuade Ford to assist, he threatens Ford with a lobotomized OG Clementine holding a gun. Bernard can’t hurt him, but since Clementine’s programing has been erased— the not hurting human protocol is inactive. Ford relents. He takes Bernard back through his memories. First stop, reading to his deceased son at the hospital. Then he gets a flash of him killing (?) Elsie.</span></p>


[caption id="attachment_4735" align="alignleft" width="141"]<img class="wp-image-4735 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/logan-512x512-141x141.jpg" alt="logan-512x512" width="141" height="141" /> Logan[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With his Confederate comrades holding Dolores, Logan shows William a picture of his sister and William’s finance. It is the same photo from the first episode that Dolores' dad saw that sent him into a fit. He is upset that William wants to take up with a robot over his sister. That’s the type of thing that would make you mad. He stabs Dolores to show William her mechanical robot parts and to illustrate that she isn’t real. Even though she’s in pain she retaliates by slicing Logan’s face and shooting some Confederates. You go little robot girl. William tells her to run and he’ll meet her later. She hears a voice which I think sounded like Bernard tell her to “remember”. She heads out to a time jump.</span></p>


[caption id="attachment_4736" align="alignleft" width="141"]<img class="wp-image-4736 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hector-escaton-512x512-141x141.jpg" alt="hector-escaton-512x512" width="141" height="141" /> Hector[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hector is chillin’ with his gang and goes off to take a piss, when Maeve shows up with a loaded shotgun. The all-knowing Maeve tells him his gang is going to shoot each other over the safe. They proceed to do so. When the blond with the snake tattoo tries to shoot Hector, Maeve takes her out with the shotgun. She tells him the safe is empty. When he checks the safe, he realizes this has all happened before. Maeve convinces him to follow her into hell so they can get back at their overlords. The way to get there, Maeve sets the tent on fire while they fuck in the flames. Don’t try this at home kids, unless you’re a host, if so then fuck your brains out.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re back with William and Logan. Logan is still trying to convince William Dolores isn’t real. The park seduces people, and William has gone overboard. William agrees that this isn’t real and it looks like the bros have made peace. Looks are deceiving though, as Logan later wakes up and finds his Confederates have been slaughtered. Logan freaks out and sees a deranged looking William. William explains he understands the game now and he wants a terrified Logan to help him find Dolores.</span></p>

[caption id="attachment_4737" align="alignleft" width="141"]<img class="wp-image-4737 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/man-in-black-512x512-141x141.jpg" alt="man-in-black-512x512" width="141" height="141" /> Man in Black[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We finally get around to the Man in Black, Teddy, Angela and the rest of Wyatt’s gang. In the last episode, Angela had stabbed Teddy with an arrow, but for once he didn’t die. She tells him to remember the massacre— we see the image of him and Wyatt killing their fellow soldiers. She gets him to see another version, one that might be closer to the truth. We see Teddy as the town sheriff gunning down innocent towns people. The same people we’ve seen Dolores possibly kill. It looks like the massacre of the original host. Teddy is shocked by this vision. She stabs Teddy and tells him when he awakes, maybe he’ll be ready to join Wyatt. Teddy is dead again! The Man in Black looks on somewhat amused and talks about the maze. Angela tells him the maze isn’t for him, and knocks him out. When the Man in Black awakens, he’s got a noose around his neck, the robe is up a tree and the other end is tied to a horse. The horse begins to take off.  Before he is hanged, he’s able to get the knife out of Teddy and cut himself loose. Out of nowhere, Charlotte shows up. The Man in Black doesn’t like people showing up taking him out of the game. The board wants his vote to push Ford out. He was the one who had helped Ford stay in business in the past. He isn’t really interested one way or the other; he is focused on the maze.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back at headquarters, Thor’s brother is getting a signal from a tech who is supposedly on vacation. We know that tech is Elsie. He decides to check it out on his own. He gets to the site where the signal is coming from but there is no sight of Elsie. While out there, he runs into members of the Ghost Nation. He gives them vocal commands to stop, but the commands don’t work and they attack him.</span></p>


[caption id="attachment_4739" align="alignleft" width="141"]<img class="wp-image-4739 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bernard-512x512-141x141.jpg" alt="bernard-512x512" width="141" height="141" /> Bernard[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The final scenes intertwine Bernard and Dolores. Bernard sees his son again, but freezes the moment and breaks it down, realizing this pain he’s feeling isn’t an event that happened to him. He flashes to the scene where Maeve has killed herself so that Ford can’t take away the pain of her daughter’s death. He can’t understand this and starts to glitch. Dolores is back at the village. Ford is talking to Bernard about Arnold. Dolores enters the church. Hosts are in the pews glitching. She goes to a confessional booth, which is really an elevator to take her to a lab downstairs. She sees a bunch of dead bodies. I don’t know if these are hosts or techs. Now we see a young Ford, I’m guessing she is back 35 years ago before the park opened. Bernard goes back to when he was created in the image of Arnold. Arnold goes to meet Dolores, she is in distress, he can’t help her because she has already killed him. Dolores goes back up to the church, it’s empty but then a figure appears at the door. She thinks it’s William, but we are in the present. It’s the Man in Black. Ford wants Bernard to join him as his sidekick again. Bernard tells OG Clementine to shoot Ford. She can’t, Ford has a backdoor to the hosts and regains control. Since Bernard didn’t rejoin him, he instructs Bernard to shoot himself. As he leaves the cold storage unit we see Bernard with the gun to his head, we hear a gunshot and see Bernard hit the floor. Ford, you bastard!!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This episode had a lot to unpack. They did a lot of jumping with the timelines, so I was kind of confused. They had visual cues like Dolores' clothes changing from frontier dress to the pants and shirt she wore with William and Logan. It still wasn’t that clear to me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Well a major fan theory is confirmed, Bernard is a replica of Ford’s old partner, Arnold. Ford created Bernard to have his old partner back, but this time under his control. What a sentimental old fool. An evil sentimental old fool. Dolores killed Arnold. I hope we see how that happened and why. Maeve is recruiting her army with Hector being her right hand man. I’m sure when they get to the lab, all hell is going to break loose. Head of security Stubb, aka Thor’s brother is suspicious about what’s going on, he might be headed for the same fate as Elsie. Whatever her fate actually is. Things really heated up between William and Logan. If the Man in Black fan theory is right, (which I believe it is), we are seeing the moment he becomes the heartless Man in Black. It was fun seeing how scared Logan was. I’m only guessing, but I don’t think Logan is getting out of this park alive. Teddy is dead again, about time Teddy realizes what’s going on, Maeve will be Empress of the world. It looks like we will be getting our long awaited showdown between the Man in Black and Dolores. I want to see her take that smirk off his face. Next week’s episode is the finale. I hope you’ll come back next week so we can unravel this season together.</span></p>
