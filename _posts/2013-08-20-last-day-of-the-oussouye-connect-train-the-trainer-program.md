The students began the day by making a brief presentation about how they planned to teach the children about Facebook. We recorded their presentations to help us evaluate the selection of the trainer and mentors.

Next we talked about Google tablets and mobile devices in general. We then reviewed a list of apps that are appropriate for the middle school audience available on the Android and iPhone market. We also discussed different types of mobile technologies (such as SMS, MMS, QR Codes, Bluetooth, NFC) and different uses of mobile technologies  in education, business, agriculture, art, and so on.

We learned two interesting facts about mobile device usage in the Ziguinchor region: 1) Many do not access the Internet with mobile devices because of their high expense and limited wi-fi accessibility. 2) Many have multiple SIM cards from different carriers to take advantage of promotional offers from different carriers.

After the tablet discussion, we asked the students to do an exercise to familiarize themselves with the all the features of the tablets.

We broke for lunch and had another delicious rice and grilled fish dish. Senegal has great food!

We came back from lunch to brainstorm about what kind of projects the children should do for the program. The students had many good ideas, such as creating Facebook pages for their academic clubs. Our suggestion was to compile their list and show it to the middle school instructors to see which ones make sense for them. From that target list, the middle school students will select a project.

After discussing the approach for coming up with a project page for the children, we moved on to talk about Google Maps. We reviewed the major concepts of what we wanted the children to learn about map making.

Before ending the training, the students designed the course schedule for each of the four sessions. The level of contribution from the students in this exercise was a major contributing factor for our selection of mentors and the trainer.

We ended the day by selecting the trainer and mentors and presenting certificates of participation to all attendees.

Our trainer is Nelson Menendez, a native of Haiti who is studying computer science in Senegal. Our mentors are Oumou Keita, Charles Sagna, Diéré Diedhiou, Ismaila Dialla, and Martial Adoye.

Next day---training middle school students!
