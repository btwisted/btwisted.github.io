We'll also give you an inside view of various <a href="https://sanfrancomiccon.com/convention-events/">events</a>, such as celebrity Q&amp;A's, exhibitor booths, gaming, and the film festival.

SFCC is a true comic book convention. <a href="http://imaginariumagency.org/">Imaginarium</a>, the organization behind SFCC, is passionate about comic books and makes sure comic books are the focus.

Jamie Kautzmann, PR spokesperson for SFCC, reiterated this sentiment: "Of course, we're excited about our celebrity guests.

We're proud to feature and showcase renowned comic creators like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Timm">Bruce Tim</a> (DC Universe), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Adams">Neil Adams</a> (Batman, Superman, Green Arrow), <a href="https://sanfrancomiccon.com/guest-bios/joyce-chin-bio/">Joyce Chin</a> (Vampirella and Xena: Warrior Princess), and many more."

In addition to comic books, SFCC features magazines, toys, games, Star Wars, Star Trek, anime, manga, cosplay, artwork, sketches, and apparel.

Of course no comic con is complete without a roster of celebrities to meet and greet attendees. This year's line up includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichelle_Nichols">Nichelle Nichols</a> (Star Trek), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Capaldi">Peter Capaldi </a>(Doctor Who), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Astin">Sean Astin</a> (Lord of the Rings), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichelle_Nichols">Summer Glau</a> (Firefly) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renee_O%27Connor">Renee O'Connor</a> (Xena: Warrior Princess).
