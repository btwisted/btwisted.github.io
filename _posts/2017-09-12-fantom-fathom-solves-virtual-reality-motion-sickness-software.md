Fantom Fathom (FF), a Virtual Reality (VR) software solutions company, will be debuting the world's first VR algorithm that solves VR-induced nausea. This patent pending technology, titled Hyper Dash, will launch alongside the first fast-paced multiplayer game created to utilize it, APEX Tournament (AT). The technology and game was featured at PAX West in <span class="xn-location">Seattle</span> earlier this month.

Fantom Fathom's revolutionary locomotive system, Hyper Dash, solves VR sickness with software only by matching player's actual movements to their character's virtual movements.  Without a controller or gesture input, users control their in-game movements by shifting their center of gravity. For the first time in VR, players will able to move around with extreme speed and jump incredibly high without the risk of VR-sickness because Hyper Dash matches their sense of balance with their in-game motion.

"We began the process to solving this problem by interviewing and observing participants playing VR games that made them dizzy," said CEO and Founder, <span class="xn-person">Douglas Liang</span>. "After deriving that the core problem of VR sickness is caused by visual and sensory dissonance, we started brainstorming on every angle, speed, input, output, designs, and mechanics. We reiterated this process with over hundreds of Concept Solutions before honing in on what we finally have today."

"Considering motion sickness represents the largest obstacle in virtual reality, the launch of this technology is one of the greatest advancements for the VR gaming space," explained CMO Cynthia Salarizadeh. "We hope to see the VR industry open up to increased investment and player participation after the industry gets its hands on this algorithm. Our confidence in its game changing ability is unparalleled."

APEX Tournament, the first game to utilize the Hyper Dash technology, is a multiplayer (6v6) team-based shooter similar to Overwatch (<a class="linkOnClick" href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-include="300513146">https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/</a>) in VR. Inspired to be MOBA in FPS, players will be able to choose and upgrade weapons strategically and teams will advance or lose territory at the end of each round until one side takes full control of all stages.

AT will be the first FPS (First Person Shooter) in VR that also successfully employs the three core elements of the world's most popular games: fast paced action, strategic positioning, and open world roaming. The technology is agnostic and will work on any VR platform, including Vive, Oculus, PSVR, and smartphone VR. It will be available for purchase later this fall on the <a class="linkOnClick" href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-include="300513146">Steam Store</a>.

Fantom Fathom will be licensing their technology through SDK and patent royalty to other gaming companies and VR industries, including healthcare, engineering, and real estate.
