Kbear gives his take on Big Little Lies, Supergirl, and Arrow.

<img class="size-full wp-image-6385 alignleft" src="http://nayahscifi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/biglittlelies.jpeg" alt="" width="269" height="187" />Did you catch <strong><em>Big Little Lies</em></strong> on HBO? I wasn’t sure if I wanted to watch it. Of course, it has an A list all-star cast and A list movie director and TV legend behind the camera. Still I’m not that interested in the life of a bunch of privileged rich people whining about their first world problems. I decided to watch it and I’m glad I did. The story is a little soapy, but the first class acting and production values make this a must watch limited series. Any movie would be glad to have this caliber of talent in it.

The main characters are Madeline Mackenzie (Reese Witherspoon), a stay at home mom who is jealous of her ex-husband's young, beautiful aerobics instructor wife (Zoë Kravitz) and is afraid of her two daughters growing up so fast. She is a busybody that many at her kid’s school don’t like. (Personally, I found her character sympathetic and likeable.) She is married to Ed Mackenzie (Adam Scott). Her best friend is Celeste Wright (Nicole Kidman), a former big shot attorney who is the mother of twin boys and is married to a younger man, Perry Wright (Alexander Skarsgard). They seem to have an idyllic life, with the beautiful house and Perry being overtly affectionate, but we later learn that Perry is controlling and abusive. They befriend the community’s newest resident, single mother June Chapman (Shailene Woodley). She is in a lower economic class than the other mothers at the school are, and she is secretive and a bit withdrawn. She might be running away from something or someone since she sleeps with a pistol under her pillow. Mackenzie’s main rival is working mom Renata Klein (Laura Dern) who is very successful but high strung. She feels like no one likes her and she could be right.

The show takes place in Monterey California, and someone is murdered at a school fundraising gala. We don’t know who is murdered or who the suspects are yet. The rivalries between the moms are very intense and everyone seems to be hiding secrets. It seems like it will be fun so I plan to continue to watch it. It is seven episodes so that’s not a big commitment to make. I might mention the show here and there during the next few weeks.
<h3>CW Berlantiverse</h3>
<strong>Supergirl</strong> / “Luthors”

<img class="size-full wp-image-6387 alignleft" src="http://nayahscifi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/supergirl2.jpeg" alt="" width="318" height="159" />The Luthors are back so you know we’re in for a great episode. We open 20 years ago at the Luthor household, Lionel Luthor comes home with a present, little Lena. I think Lillian Luthor (Brenda Strong) would have preferred roses. Back in the present Kara (Melissa Benoist) and Mon-El (Chris Wood) have another awkward meeting at the bar. Hank (David Harewood), James (Mehcad Brooks), and Winn (Jeremy Jordan) are there to meet Alex’s (Chyler Leigh) new “fellow”. They didn’t suspect it would be Maggie (Floriana Lima) except for Hank, he can read minds. No drama here, they are all sincerely happy for Alex. Lena Luthor (Katie McGrath) had to testify against Lillian at her trial for trying to kill the alien population of National City. Kara goes to Lena’s office to offer her support. Lillian wants Lena to visit her in jail; Lena understandably doesn’t want to go. Kara convinces her to see her mother; she wishes she had the chance to talk to the ones she has lost.

Lillian reveals Lena is the illegitimate daughter of Lionel. Lionel had an affair, he paid the mother off, but she died when Lena was four, so he brought her home with him and he and Lillian adopted her. The reasons she wasn’t closer to Lena were Lionel didn’t want her interacting with Lena and Lena looks just like her biological mother and that upset Lillian. She would like another chance with Lena to be a better parent. Metallo (Frederick Schmidt) receives a package in jail. He is testifying in Lillian’s trial. He states how much he hates Supergirl, that all aliens are bad and that Lillian is only trying to protect humanity. He reveals that the item that was in his package is Kryptonite, the Kryptonite powers him up and he starts destroying the courtroom to free Lillian.

Kara had been in the courtroom as a reporter, she greets Lillian and Metallo outside as Supergirl. Metallo shoots a gigantic crane and Lillian gives her a choice, rescue the people below or capture her. Supergirl saves the crowd. Everyone thinks Lena helped Lillian and Metallo escape. No one had visited Metallo the night he got the package, but Lena did visit Lillian that night. Kara goes to support Lena; Maggie arrives with a video showing Lena possessing Kryptonite, she arrests her. Snapper Carr (Ian Gomez) puts her on the cover of the paper. James admits he agrees with Snapper, Lena is guilty. Kara runs into Eve Teschmacher (Andrea Brooks), she asks how she and Mike (Mon-El’s earth identity) are doing. She tells Kara they only went on one date and he spent most of it talking about Kara. Eve told him he shouldn’t go out until he was over his old girlfriend. Kara says they never dated. Eve says he said the same. She gives Kara a knowing smile. Kara giggles over Mon-El liking her.

Lena is in jail, Metallo shows up to break her out. So does the Guardian to prevent it. They fight but Metallo eventually defeats Guardian. Metallo takes Lena. Back at the DEO, Alex is patching up James. James says this confirms that Lena is guilty. Kara thinks she was kidnapped. The rest of the DEO crew agrees with James. Kara storms out; James catches up with her. He tells her that Clark and Lex were best friends. Clark wouldn’t believe that Lex was evil. The Luthors are evil; why can’t Kara trust him? He doesn’t need her protections but he does want her trust. Kara goes downstairs to kick some concrete blocks out of frustration. Mon-El goes down there to check up on her. He doesn’t say whether he thinks Lena is guilty but he is glad Kara believed in him. Kara apologizes to Mon-El for being cold to him. They discuss him not dating Eve. He asks why Kara was mad at him for dating Eve. Kara gets evasive and leaves the room.

In the get-away van, Lena is mad at Metallo and Lillian for breaking her out of jail. Lillian tells her everyone thinks she is guilty anyway because she is a Luthor. (She is right about that.) She invites Lena to join Cadmus, allow Lillian to be the mom she always wanted. Lena is confused because she would like to have an actual mother-daughter relationship. She soon finds out this was all BS. When they arrive at the secret facility Lex had set up, they need Luthor DNA to open the facility’s vault. Lena refuses but the real Hank Henshaw (Cyborg Superman) appears and forces her hand on the vault’s pad. Back at the DEO, after some prodding from Kara, Winn discovers the video is corrupted, he is able to get to the original video and it shows Cyborg Superman getting the Kryptonite. They are able to trace the Kryptonite that is in the secret facility and determine that it isn’t real Kryptonite but synthetic Kryptonite. It is unstable and ready to blow up the facility with Lena in it. Even though the Kryptonite can kill her, Kara leaves to rescue Lena. When she gets to the facility she tells them Metallo will die from this synthetic Kryptonite and the facility is about to explode. The villains don’t care, a fight commences. Just as things, look bad for Supergirl, the Martian Manhunter shows up to help her. Cyborg Superman and Lillian escape on a helicopter, while Kara, Hank, and Lena escape before the facility explodes.

Cleared of all charges Lena is a free woman. James apologizes to Kara and they both decide to get over their current disagreements and get back to being friends again. Kara goes over to Lena’s office. Lena has covered Kara’s office in flowers to thank her. She calls Kara her hero; she never had a friend like her before, someone who will stand up for her. Kara assures her she will be there for her. They hug and Kara leaves. Lena absentmindedly picks up one of her chest pieces and flashes back 20 years ago playing chest with Lex. Little Lena says checkmate and tells Lillian she likes this game. Lillian studies her and says, “Maybe you are a Luthor.”  (Watch out Supergirl!)

Mon-El goes over to Kara’s apartment. Kara confesses she is more comfortable protecting others than she is protecting herself. She isn’t comfortable being vulnerable. Last year she thought she could have it all, and then decided she couldn’t and picked being Supergirl over having a relationship. Then along came Mon-El, she kept writing him off but he kept proving her wrong. She now thinks, maybe I can have it all. As they move in for a kiss someone named Mr. Mxyzptlk (Peter Gadiot) appears and tells Kara he is there to marry her. (They should call him Mr. Cockblocker.)

<strong>Arrow</strong> / “Spectre of the Gun”

<img class="size-full wp-image-6388 alignleft" src="http://nayahscifi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/oliver_thea.jpeg" alt="" width="274" height="184" />This week’s episode rated a TV 14 LV, for language and violence. Maybe the first Arrow episode to deal with real world issues in as realistic as a superhero show can attempt to do it.  Thea Queen (Willa Holland) is back and she isn’t crazy about Oliver (Stephen Amell) dating Susan. She also isn’t thrilled that Rene (Rick Gonzalez) has a job in city hall as Lance’s (Paul Blackthrone) assistant. A man in a delivery uniform pulls an AR 15 out and shoots up city hall. Adrian Chase (Josh Segarra) is shot. Rene hits the gunman with a few shot but he is wearing body armor.  Oliver checks on all the shooting victims, Adrian is fine. Unfortunately, five are dead and twenty-four are injured. Adrian wants to leave the hospital to find the shooter but they persuade him to get some rest.

Back at the Arrow cave, Rene and Curtis (Echo Kellum) are debating gun control. You can guess who is on which side of the issue. To everyone’s surprise, Lance agrees with Curtis but newbie Dinah Drake (Juliana Harkavy) agrees with Rene. Felicity (Emily Brett Rickards) would like for all of them to shut up while she works. Oliver has a thug hanging upside down trying to track down the shooter. Vigilante pops up and shoots the upside down thug. I guess he is on Renee and Dinah’s side. Lance got a good look at the shooter as he passed him near the elevators, so Felicity is able to track him down. (Why aren’t the police doing this; right its Star City, the most incompetent police force in the world.) The shooter’s name is James Edlund (Cliff Chamberlin), a regular law abiding citizen until his family was killed in a mall shooting. He shot up city hall because the previous administration would not pass a gun registry ordinance. Oliver holds a press conference on the shooting. He won’t give his opinion on gun control. One reason he won’t give his opinion is that he doesn’t know what to do. He is worried about the vicious cycle of violence. Lance and Thea tell him the solution to this problem is through the mayor, not as the Green Arrow. Mayor Oliver Queen decides to take the issue on.

Oliver meets with Councilwoman Pollard (Laara Sidiq), the person who killed the original gun registry ordinance. He and she are going to work out a solution together. Diggle and Dinah are looking for Edlund. John asks if she has moved out of the old Hive headquarters yet. She hasn’t and he asks why she hasn’t moved out of that dump. She had found a nice apartment with a garden but hadn’t taken it because that feels normal and she no longer feels normal. John understands and tells her she has to give herself permission to be herself again, one small step is getting that studio apartment with a garden. Felicity still doesn’t want Curtis and Rene debating gun control. Curtis asks when it became wrong to discuss politics openly in a rational way. Felicity has to ponder that. She gets a hit on a support group for violence victims that Edlund was once a member. Curtis and Rene go to investigate and they hear stories of how gun violence have affected these people. Curtis asks Rene what does he think, Rene still believes guns save lives, if he had one on him his wife would still be alive. Curtis didn’t know he had been married. They get information on where Edlund might be and find his hideout. They know what his next target is, Starling General.

Team Arrow is in position but instead of the Green Arrow appearing, Mayor Oliver Queen talks to Edlund. He understands Edlund’s anger but it didn’t give him the right to kill the people in city hall. Edlund puts a gun to his head; Oliver tells him he has to live to keep his family’s memory alive. Edlund puts his gun down and the police arrest him. Oliver and Councilwoman Pollard are able to strike a deal. (So that is all it takes to get gun control legislation through. It is a good thing the NRA didn’t show up, nothing would have happened accept Oliver getting the privilege to attend five funerals. I guess the NRA doesn’t exist in the Arrowverse.)

The flashback this week was about Rene. His wife Laura Ramirez (Samaire Armstrong) is a recovering drug addict. Rene finds drugs in the house; they have a daughter named Zoe (Eliza Faria). He cannot have this in the house so he issues an ultimatum to his wife, no drugs or no wife. He and Zoe leave for her basketball game. When they return the apartment is in shambles. Laura’s drug dealer is holding her at gunpoint for his payment. Rene agrees to pay him off but goes to his safe to get his gun. He shoots the drug dealer but the drug dealer shoots Laura dead. Afterwards, the authorities take Rene’s daughter from him and place her in foster care. In despair, he sees the Green Arrow kill Damien Darhk on TV. He decides he wants to join him. Back in the present, Curtis has a lawyer friend and they are going to help Rene regain custody of his daughter. Two opponents on gun control bond over friendship and mutual respect. Oh yeah and Dinah gets the apartment and joins the Star City police. So are all of Team Arrow going to be city employees soon?
