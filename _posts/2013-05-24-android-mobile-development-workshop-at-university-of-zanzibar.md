<p dir="ltr">Nayah Solutions, Inc. is proud to announce the sponsorship of a four-day Android mobile development workshop at The State University of Zanzibar (SUZA) from May 27 to May 30, 2013.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thiago Santos, a software engineer at Google, Inc. and an advisory board member at Nayah Solutions, is the instructor. Mr. Santos has extensive experience in mobile application design and implementation. He is currently a member of the Project Glass team that develops <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/what-it-does/">Google Glass</a>, a wearable computer with a head-mounted display.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> The workshop covers the setup of the Android development environment, basic concepts and abstractions for Android development, and an overview of the Android application market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The workshop participants consist of faculty and students from the SUZA computer science department. As a prerequisite, participants were required to learn basic Java programming concepts that are useful for mobile application development.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> After setting up the development environment and learning basic Android concepts, participants brainstorm and decide on the applications they want to build. Then they form teams to develop the applications. At the conclusion of the workshop, teams demonstrate their applications and have the opportunity to submit outstanding applications to the Android market.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> The Android workshop reflects the mission of Nayah Solutions to provide training in relevant computing technologies to universities and high schools in Sub-Saharan Africa, and also provides SUZA with tools and content they can use to create mobile development courses for its curriculum.</p>
