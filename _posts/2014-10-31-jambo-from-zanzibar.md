I have been in Zanzibar for almost a month and this is my first post. The challenges with reliable internet were more than I ever imagined.  When you combine occasional electrical outages, it compounds the problem. I've been to Africa several times over the past seven years, and know first-hand about problems with internet. But for some reason, this has been the toughest challenge.

Connections are adequate for checking email and surfing the web. But if you need to upload, download, stream data, it's nearly impossible. Since my plan is to introduce <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/" target="_blank">App Inventor</a> to youngsters, we need stronger connections. Most of those lessons are online videos. It is hard to see a entire video without constant interruptions. Of course I can work around it by purchasing a book on the subject. But fast reliable internet is still necessary to develop mobile apps.

From my brief time here, I have identified a high-level approach for implementing our program. Of course at this point priorities can shift.
<p style="color: #333333;">1) Develop and maintain strong broadband/internet connection at the university--especially the innovation center where we'll be conducting our App Inventor mentoring and training sessions.</p>
<p style="color: #333333;">2) Adapt the App Inventor material to Kiswahili and make it available online. (Some suggest the material should be presented in English. If that is the final decision, we can use existing App Inventor online material)</p>
<p style="color: #333333;">3) Work on making this program sustainable when grants from outside sources are not available.</p>
<p style="color: #333333;">4) Engage targeted schools and select the appropriate students. Make sure to get parents excited too!</p>
Of course, all my focus right now is on point #1. The staff at the university are fully committed to providing adequate internet access.  They have been absolutely wonderful with their support and enthusiasm. I just hope there is an adequate infrastructure on the island to ensure success.

Of course, I'll be reporting on our progress.

Zaidi baadaye!
