In Kiswahili, pole (po-lay) pole, means slowly. And I am making slow, but steady progress. Despite challenges with slow internet and minor electrical outages, I make progress--pole pole. Here is quick update.

1) Nayah Solutions has identified a wonderful community center:Tanzania Youth Icon (TAYI). They invite local youth who have dropped out of school to join. They ask the youth what would they like to learn. Then they find someone in the community to volunteer and teach that subject. Some learn to make bracelets, photography, sign language, English, communication skills, and so on. The youth are actively engaged because they are learning a skill that interests them. It keeps them off the streets with positive activities and they learn a skill that could potentially earn them a living. It gives them hope! Nayah Solutions will introduce <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">App Inventor</a> to the youth who have expressed interest in learning how to create Android mobile apps.

Three students and two lecturers from university that will learn App Inventor and go to the community center and conduct train-the-trainer sessions. In addition we'll identify other middle or high school students to train in Zanzibar. And the best part is that the center, through charitable donations, has adequate Internet connection and speed. So we <em>should</em> be able to download tutorials and create apps. But you never know about the Internet on this island.

<p style="text-align: left;">2) Nayah Solutions is conducting an SAT prep tutoring for a few high school students in Stone Town. They were given a 2007 SAT prep book and told to study on their own! I went online to Khan Academy and found the latest SAT practice exams and tutorials. Now I coach them on the reading and writing comprehension sections-- since English is not their native language. Please wish them luck. They take the test December 6 2014.</p>

3) Nayah Solutions is actively collaborating on the design and development of an innovation center at the university. The pilot phase will occur in a room in the university until we are able to construct a dedicated space. I will not provide details now because the success of the plan is contingent on two factors: the university must solve its Internet connection problems, and they must acquire solar panels as a backup to electrical outages. When these issues are addressed, I will feel more confident to share the plan. And I feel sure we will be able to raise funds to build and equip the center. This innovation center has the potential to make a dent in the soaring unemployment statistics among youth on the island.

4) The students in my communication skills class for computing students are doing very well. Of course we have our ups and downs, but far more ups than downs! I teach them communication skills as they work in real-world development team scenarios. Each group has to develop a product or service. They have already completed their quantitative research on what they want to offer to the market.  Each group has a program manager, product manager, software developer, technical writer, and so on. We also take a day each week for them to present Powerpoint presentations to improve their public speaking skills. I've seen incredible improvement since the first week. I hope to share videos of their final projects at the end of the semester.
