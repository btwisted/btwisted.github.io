<p style="text-align: left;">Star Wars Celebration is a fan gathering to celebrate the <i><a title="Star Wars" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars">Star Wars</a></i> franchise. Like many Star Wars fans, I watched the <i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi </i>panel at the Star Wars celebration this year.  As a reward, I received a poster, a teaser trailer for <em>Star Wars: Episode 8</em>, a trailer for <em>Star Wars Rebels</em>, and a trailer for a new <em>Star Wars Battlefront II</em> game!  I walked around with a smile on my face all weekend long.

<h4><strong>Star Wars: Battlefront II</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <em>Star Wars: Battlefront II</em> game looks really cool with next-gen graphics, a single player campaign, and a brand new character named Iden Versio.  She leads a special forces team whose gear from the trailer calls back to the Inquisitor's gear in Star Wars Rebels. From what we glimpse in the trailer, they are hell-bent on revenge on the Alliance/ New Republic. It echoes the storyline from the <em>Star Wars: Aftermath</em> novels that recently wrapped up. Hopefully, it's a deeper dive into the origins of <em>The First Order</em> and the events that led up to <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>.  A lot of fans and I were extremely disappointed with the first <em>Star Wars: Battlefront</em>. Hopefully, EA can get it right this time. </span>

<h4><strong>Star Wars Rebels</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hot on the heels of season 3 of <em>Star Wars Rebels</em>, the season 4 trailer gives goosebumps to all its fans. What is the ultimate fate of the crew of the Ghost? Where are Ezra and Kanan in the original trilogy? From everything being revealed on the show, <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> is moving the Force users toward balance, not just the light side versus the dark side. This balance gives a lot of room for dynamic storytelling on the part of Dave Filoni and company. Fans appreciate that Filoni is slowly bringing in Star Wars Legends material, like Grand Admiral Thrawn. Hopefully, that trend continues.  So many questions need to be answered before they wrap up the final season of <em>Star Wars Rebels, </em>mainly where is Ashoka Tano??</span>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</span></h4>
Finally, the new trailer for Episode 8 dropped and left more questions than answers. Luke SkyWalker says, "I only know one truth. It's time for the Jedi to end." It makes one wonder where this is all heading. Is Luke embracing the dark side? Are the books in the cave the fabled journal of the Willis?  In the voice-over you also hear him say there is so much more. I figure he's talking about the Force and the connection every force has to this mystical power. The visuals were amazing for the little we actually saw. Director Rian Johnson said it's meant to capture the tone of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, which fills me with existential dread. I'm nervous that they will just try and duplicate the original trilogy. It's safe not to venture outside the box, but Star Wars and Lucasfilm's were built on taking chances. We shall see in December 2017.
