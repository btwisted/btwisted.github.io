The Handmaid's Tale is a story told in the first person by a woman called Offred (literally Of-Fred). The character is one of a class of women kept for reproductive purposes and known as "handmaids" by the ruling class in an era of declining births due to sterility from pollution and sexually transmitted diseases.

The Handmaid's Tale premieres on Hulu on April 26.
