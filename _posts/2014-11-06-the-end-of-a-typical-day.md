Since I am on a TIGHT personal budget, I haven't had a chance to do tourist activities--visiting neighboring islands, snorking, sailing, visiting mainland Tanzania. I still haven't seen all of Stone Town. Before I leave I will get to do those things.

In the meantime one of my few luxuries is to eat at restaurant that edges out toward the ocean. At the end of the day, I treat myself to a beer (since it's so hot!) and either a great veggie burger or other interesting items on the menu. It's a mid-range priced restaurant, with incredible views of the ocean. I relax and unwind there each workday evening. The breezes are cool and you can see the local fishing boats and the fabulous yachts of the rich.

Then as the sun sets, I head to my apartment.

On the way to my apartment I have to travel through Forodhani Park. It's a great open square by the ocean that becomes a food market at night. You can find all the local dishes. Folks gather, sit around, and enjoy the evening.

I try to keep that relaxed feeling.  Then I lose it when I try to use the internet!!!
