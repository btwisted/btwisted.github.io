Nayah Solutions, through The State University of Zanzibar (SUZA) and sponsorship from the United Nations Industry and Development Organization (UNIDO), delivered a five-day train-the-trainer course called Entrepreneurial and IT Skills for Small Business. The Zanzibar Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (ZNCCIA) will use this course to train small business owners in Zanzibar.

The course introduces six essential business skills: Professionalism, Strategy, Communications, Marketing and Branding, Sales, and Finance. The course uses a hands-on, practical approach that students, regardless of any level, can use immediately to improve their business–even students with little or no formal education.

The main objectives of this training were to train the principal and backup trainers for the course, and to receive feedback from participants to fine tune the quality and design of the course content. To our delight participants were able to apply the lessons immediately to their unique business challenges–such as improving deficiencies in employee professionalism, writing effective emails and instructions, introducing their businesses in 30 seconds or less, and developing a marketing plan for one of the participants. In addition the participants provided invaluable input and feedback to customize the training for a Zanzibar audience. We are working now to incorporate that feedback. Upon completion of these revisions, ZNCCIA will offer the course in the next few weeks.

For Nayah Solutions, entrepreneurial and IT skills training for small business is a departure from the focus of mobile and web development training. Over the last few months, Nayah Solutions has seen a dire need to support the needs of an informal sector who develop small businesses, but lack the formal education and training to optimize their businesses and fully participate in the formal business sector.

During the next few weeks, Nayah Solutions will share more about our plans to embrace this sector. We are extremely excited on the impact we can make in emerging markets to help any audience learn practical and useful business and IT skills.
