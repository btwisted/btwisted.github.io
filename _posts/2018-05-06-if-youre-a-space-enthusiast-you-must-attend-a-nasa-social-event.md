On Saturday, May 5, 2018 NASA launched the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/insight/main/index.html">Mars InSight Lander to study the interior of Mars</a>. This launch was the first to another planet from the West Coast.

Nayah Sci Fi had the privilege to attend the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/connect/social/">NASA Social event </a>before the launch to chat with the engineers and scientists on the mission team. We also had a chance to tour <a href="http://www.spacearchive.info/vafbsked.htm">Vandenberg AFB</a> and get an inside look on what it takes to successfully launch such an ambitious effort.

In addition to all the great information and exposure to the science behind the Mars InSight lander, we met some fantastic people who attended the social. These folks came from all over the United States and represented diverse backgrounds in such fields as sports, law, education, entertainment, and technology.  Here are a few voices we captured to give you an idea of the impact of this NASA social event, with the hope you'll attend one.

<strong>Note</strong>: Special shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/NASASocial">Stephanie, Kaitlyn and Ryan with the NASA Social team</a>. Thanks for a memorable experience!!
