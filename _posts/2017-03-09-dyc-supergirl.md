The episode picks up where it ended the week before. Mr. Mxyzptlk (Peter Gadiot) is an imp from the 5<sup>th</sup> dimension. They are reality bending creatures. He puts Kara (Melissa Benoist) in a wedding dress and sends a hostile Mon-El (Chris Wood) in his boxers to DEO.  There is a robbery and Mxyzptlk show up to stop it. He points the robbers’ guns at them and shoots. Kara has to catch the bullets to save the crooks. Mon-El has dealt with them on Daxom; their method of dealing with the imps, crush them. If you can make them say their name backwards, you can get them to leave.

A parasite creature appears on the streets; Kara and Mon-El are fighting it. A caped figure flies in and defeats the creature. Kara thinks it is her cousin Superman, it’s not Clark, it is Mxyzptlk in a Superman suit with a big M on his chest. He sent the creature so he can defeat it to impress Kara. He has no concern about the damage he is causing and will create more damage if he can’t have Kara. (What a guy!) Mon-El is jealous of Mxyzptlk and gets in an argument with Kara. She tells Mon-El she can handle this but his male pride won’t allow him to hear her.

Mon-El finds a device at the DEO that can cut Mxyzptlk from his connection to the 5<sup>th</sup> dimension and looks to fight him. The device initially works but Mxyzptlk is able to reverse it. Kara flies in and saves Mon-El. To stop all of the destruction she will marry Mxyzptlk tomorrow at the Fortress of Solitude. Mon-El apologizes for his behavior and begs her not to marry Mxyzptlk. Kara tell him to go away. She meets Mxyzptlk at the Fortress and tells him she won’t marry him. He makes one of the giant ice sculptures come to life and attack her. Kara has to smash it.  She set the Fortress on auto-destruct and he types in the code to stop it. Unfortunately, for him Kara has tricked him into typing his name backwards. He’s a lonely guy but still a creep so back he goes to the 5<sup>th</sup> dimension. Kara explains to Mon-El, she was tough on him because Mxyzptlk could have been listening. They kiss and fall back on the couch.

Maggie (Floriana Lima) hates Valentine’s Day. That is too bad for Alex (Chyler Leigh) because she is excited to share it with Maggie. She makes a romantic dinner for Maggie but she becomes upset. Alex asks Maggie why she hates Valentine’s Day so much. When Maggie was a teenager, she had a friend who she liked more than a friend. She gave this girl a romantic Valentine’s Day card. This ‘friend’ outed her and Maggie’s parents threw her out of the house. Kara speaks to Maggie later and tells her how important this Valentine’s Day is for her sister. Maggie makes a big romantic production to show her love for Alex.

Winn (Jeremy Jordan) is at the bar and a couple of ruffians try to pick a fight with him. An alien woman name Lyra (Tamzin Merchant) saves him. She invites him out for a date. Since he works with aliens all the time Winn is quick to accept. They have a great time together.
