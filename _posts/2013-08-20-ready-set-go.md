Saturday, August 17 was the first session of Oussouye Connect, social media and map-making training for 15 students from CEM Aline Sitoe Diatta in Oussouye, Senegal.

The training began with the middle school students introducing themselves and giving us a chance to inquire about their level of technology proficiency. Most had Facebook experience. Few knew how to use Google maps.

After introductions the trainer, Nelson Menendez, introduced the entire program to the students. Next, he instructed the mentors to organize their mentoring groups and distribute tablets to each group. The students and mentors spent time familiarizing themselves with the features of the tablets and then downloading appropriate apps.

After lunch, the mentors spent more time with students to get to know them better. They allowed their groups to assign team roles and further explore the tablets. The mentors quickly realized one of their more important tasks will be to coach their students on delivering presentations. Although the students were extremely bright and eager, they were extremely shy during their introductions. The mentors will work with students each week on improving their public speaking skills.

Next Saturday, August 24, students will begin their Facebook projects.
