A family of aliens are listening to Bruno Mars on a road trip. A police car pulls them over. The police officer seems friendly and tells the father that he has a broken taillight and the police officer has some tape to repair it. A van pulls up with Cadmus thugs who abduct the family. The DEO looks at the reports of aliens abductions by Cadmus. Kara (Melissa Benoist) wants to write a front-page story about it to warn aliens. Her editor Snapper Carr (Ian Gomez) won’t publish it unless she gets two people to verify it. Just having Supergirl tell her isn’t good enough. She offers to have Supergirl give him an exclusive. He’ll talk to Supergirl in person. At the bar, Alex (Chyler Leigh) tells Maggie (Floriana Lima) she is worried about Jeremiah (Dean Cain) being caught in the crossfire between the DEO and Cadmus. James (Mehcad Brooks) and Winn (Jeremy Jordan) discuss the good relationship he is having with Lyra (Tamzin Merchant). Cadmus thugs storm into the bar and get into a gunfight with Alex and Maggie. Winn tries to stop them from taking Lyra, but he is no match for them. The Guardian shows up to help but the Cadmus thugs get away with Lyra.

<b>No alternative facts here!</b>
Winn is worried and furious that Cadmus abducted Lyra. He blames Jeremiah since he is the one who stole the National Alien Registry. Alex feels guilty about this. The captured Cadmus prisoner’s mind is shielded from Hank (David Harewood) being able to read it. Alex decides to interrogate him herself and proceeds to beat the crap out of him to get him to talk. Hank has to pull her out of the room. Supergirl flies in to talk to Snapper. Snapper asks her a series of questions she can’t or won’t answer. Snapper won’t print the article because Supergirl won’t give him enough facts to verify the story.

<strong>You’re the only Superman we need
</strong>Jeremiah shows up in Alex’s apartment. He tells her he is only pretending to go along with Cadmus. The abducted aliens will be killed unless she can get him a device from DEO to save them. Alex agrees to help him and suddenly Jeremiah transforms into Hank. Hank did this as a test to check Alex’s judgement. He can’t trust her concerning Jeremiah so he suspends her from this case. Lillian Luthor (Brenda Strong) and the real Jeremiah are at a hidden Cadmus base watching the aliens they have abducted herded into a spaceship. Lillian quotes Friedrich Nietzsche about humans being supermen and tells Jeremiah, “You’re the only Superman we need.” (Cute quote since Dean Cain played Superman on “Lois and Clark”.)

Back at Alex’s apartment, she asks Kara to talk to Hank about letting her back on the case to protect their dad. Kara doesn’t like the way Hank tricked Alex into thinking he was Jeremiah, but she does agree with Hank suspending her. She thinks Alex isn’t thinking enough about the aliens who were abducted and is liable to get herself hurt. Maggie doesn’t agree with Kara’s assessment and agrees to help Alex go rogue. Kara runs into Lena Luthor (Katie McGrath) at CatCo. They had a date to go somewhere but Kara had totally forgotten about it. She is thinking about the article Snapper won’t publish. Lena suggest she write a blog to warn the aliens. She will check LexCorp records to see if Lillian has left any breadcrumbs on her whereabouts. The phony cop who helped abduct the alien family from the beginning of the episode tries the same trick on Brian (Josh Hallem), a regular at the alien bar. This time, Maggie and Alex show up to disrupt their plan. Alex uses a device on the van speedometer to determine where the Cadmus base is. Alex tells Maggie she is going to the base alone. Lena finds one of Lillian’s breadcrumbs, Lena’s assistant Alana (Jaylee Hamidi) calls Lillian to inform her. Lillian tells her to stop Lena, short of doing serious damage to her. (I don’t know if Lillian cares a little about her daughter or has plans for her.) Alex sneaks into the Cadmus base but is captured. Jeremiah shows up and tells the troops to hand her over to him.

Jeremiah and Alex have their long awaited talk. He tells her he is doing all of this to protect her and Kara, Lillian threatened to kill them if he didn’t cooperate. He talked Lillian into deporting the aliens instead of killing them. They are going to send them across the galaxy and have them fend for themselves. Alex doesn’t agree with this solution. She asks him not to do this for either her or Kara; they don’t want this. Mon-El (Chis Wood) sees Kara’s story on her computer. She can’t decide whether to launch it online. Mon-El trusts her judgement and encourages her to press the button. She knows she’ll be in trouble for this but does it anyway. Lena calls, she knows where the Cadmus base is, and it is an abandoned LexCorp site. Some Cadmus thugs chase her and she falls out the window, Kara hears this on the phone and shows up as Supergirl to catch her. (Lena seems to be Kara’s very own Lois Lane.) Lillian sees the online story and decides to step up the alien launch. Alex has a trick up her sleeve; before she was captured, she had planted bombs throughout the base. She has a dead man switch on her phone if anyone tries to stop her from setting off the bombs. To show Lillian she isn’t bluffing she sets one of the bombs off. She gets Jeremiah to switch sides and help her. She boards the ship and is able to free Lyra and the other aliens from their cages. Cyborg Superman shows up and defeats Jeremiah. He and Lillian are back in control and she launhces the spaceship. Supergirl shows up just in time and with Alex’s encouragement is able to stop the ship from accelerating to light speed and leaving the galaxy.

Lyra and Winn are reunited. Hank apologizes to Alex. Alex says to Hank about both of them, “Stop doing wrong things for the right reasons.” They make up and Hank reinstates Alex. Not everyone gets a happy conclusion. Snapper fires Kara for publishing a CatCo story online. It violates her contract and violates good journalistic practice. Snapper was pulling for Kara becoming a good journalist. Kara tells Mon-El, “Supergirl is what I can do. Kara is who I am.” Journalism was her calling.

In the end credit, we see the aliens on the spaceship who have been looking for Mon-El this season. They finally show their faces; it is Teri Hatcher and Kevin Sarbo. (Hello Lois and Hercules.)

The past two episodes have been about Alex’s struggle to deal with her father’s betrayal. It is a hard road for Alex to travel. With Maggie’s help, she is able to make the journey. Chyler Leigh was excellent again in this episode. All of the juicy material they have given her this season, from her coming out story, her new romance with Maggie, and her father’s betrayal and redemption, she has acted the hell out of it. Last season she was underutilized, but this season the writers seem to know the prize they have in her. Melissa Benoist was also great in this episode. I really was glad Kara was fired from CatCo. She is sincere, but there is no way a newspaper would not have fired her for what she did. I liked that even though Snapper talked to Supergirl in person, he didn’t just take everything she said as gospel truth. It’s not that he didn’t believe her, but as a journalist, he needed to verify her statement and she wasn’t providing him with anything. Therefore, it was good having him do something bad to Kara but having it be justified. He is not the bad guy in this situation. Two people trying to do the right thing but someone getting hurt. That’s life.
