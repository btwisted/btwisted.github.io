As we saw at the end of the last episode, Evil Rip Hunter (Arthur Darvill) is able to communicate with Gideon. For some reason the Legends aren’t aware of this fact. You’d think that someone would have thought that the man who commanded this ship for all these years would know how to access the ship’s AI. For story purposes, they don’t think about it.  Rip leaves his cell, and overrides Sara’s (Caity Lotz) commands altering the ship’s flight and begins the ship’s self-destruct sequence. He destroys the medallion with the Spear of Destiny info before Mick (Dominic Purcell) knocks him unconscious. Jax (Franz Drameh) is able to rewire the computer to override the self-destruct command. They crash land in the cretaceous era, the era Ray (Brandon Routh) was stuck in at the beginning of the season. The engine part they need to time jump is lost outside; Ray, Amaya (Maisie Richardson-Sellers), and Nate (Mick Zano) are sent to retrieve it. Mick tells Sara and Martin (Victor Garber) that the Time Masters had a cognitive invasion device to get inside people’s heads. Sara decides they will use it to get into Rip’s head.

Amaya saves Nate from a huge prehistoric snake. Merlin/Stargirl from the previous episode gave her the idea she should fully embrace her new life so she is ready to explore further her and Nate’s relationship. Before they can start exploring the three of them have to run from a dinosaur.

With Martin and Mick monitoring the procedure, Sara and Jax enter Rip’s sub- conscience. His mindscape is a mirror image of the Waverider except it is a much darker dangerous place. Sara and Jax are attacked by Evil Rip’s version of Sara.

When Ray was previously there, he ate some of Gertrude’s eggs. The T-Rex didn’t take kindly to Ray’s culinary habits. Nate and Amaya are too busy flirting to care.

Inside Rip’s head, Sara is fighting an evil version of Atom and Jax is thrown in the brig where the good version of Rip is imprisoned. This version of Rip is meek. Jax meets a human form of Gideon (Amy Pemberton, who also is the voice of Gideon). Rip would have Gideon be a lovely woman.

</strong>Ray tells Nate to knock it off with Amaya. Ray isn’t being a busybody; he has a valid reason to voice his objection to their relationship. Ray knows Amaya is going to have a granddaughter who inherits her powers; he met Mari on “Arrow”. She has to go back to Africa and have her daughter. Her village destroyed; Mari moves to America, and lives in foster care. Nate wants to tell Amaya but Ray advises against it. Amaya’s destiny is important, and they shouldn’t mess with it.

Sara goes to the brig to rescue Jax; Rip is scared of Sara because he thinks she is the evil version. The procedure the Legion of Doom did to Rip made his memories backwards and makes him think the Legends are evil. The evil Legends are Rip’s captors. Sara convinces Rip to break out. Gideon says she has artifacts in the bridge that can get Rip to remember who he was.  Fortunately, for everyone, the Legion of Doom didn’t think Gideon was important enough to tamper in Rip’s memories, so she is still good. Evil Firestorm and Sara show up; Sara and Jax have to fight them.

The missing engine part is in Gertrude’s territory so Ray, Nate, and Amaya get it. Gertrude charges after the group but Amaya uses her Vixen power and communicates with the T-Rex. Nate is impressed.

</strong>Sara and Jax defeat their evil counterparts and Rip is finally able to gain control of his mind. He is able to expel the evil Legends. Sara and Jax leave his mind before they are trapped there. Rip and Gideon have a heart to heart and kiss. Rip wakes up as the good Captain Rip Hunter.

The AI Gideon remembers the kiss. (This could be trouble.) Everyone is glad to see Rip back to normal. He remembers all the bad things he did, and apologizes to Sara for trying to kill her. Rip also remembers where the last piece of the Spear of Destiny is.

We are now in Houston at NASA in 1970. Apollo 13 commander John Swigert is getting his medical examination from the medical examiner, Eobard Thawne (Matt Letscher). Houston we have a problem!

This episode was a bottle episode. Productions do this to save money. It usually takes place on one or two sets and costs are kept to a minimum. There weren’t a lot of special effects this episode and the ones they had didn’t look that good. Gertrude looked closer to the dinosaurs on the 1970s TV series “Land of the Lost” than the dinosaurs we see in the movies or TV. (I exaggerate but it wasn’t good.) The special effects they use for Firestorm weren’t up to their usual standards. The story itself wasn’t bad. The storyline with Ray, Amaya, and Nate was pretty funny. Brandon Routh is very good with light comedy. I liked his rivalry with Gertrude. The story aboard the Waverider reminded me of several other genre shows. On “Legion” they are going through the main character’s memories. Rip’s memories aren’t as terrifying as David Haller’s.  Rip’s relationship reminded me of the “Doctor Who” episode “The Doctor’s Wife” when the TARDIS consciousness was transferred to Idris, a woman. The episode explored the special relationship between the Doctor and the TARDIS. We get to see the special relationship Rip has with Gideon. Like the Doctor, he and his ship kiss. Boys and their toys.
