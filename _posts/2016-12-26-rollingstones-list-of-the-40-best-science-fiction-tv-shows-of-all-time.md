When you see a list of the best of anything, you know it's going to be controversial. And the list of the 40 best science fiction shows is no exception. Basically, I like the list. It captures most of the relevant science fiction shows over the past 60 years. Although, I have to admit a couple of shows on the list are unfamiliar and obscure to me. In my list, <em>Farscape</em> and <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em> would have easily replaced those shows. Also the list is generous with including newer shows such as <em>Jessica Jones</em> and <em>Orphan Black</em>. But no love for <em>The Expanse</em>?

Here's  RollingStone's top 10 list:

10. Outer Limits

9.   Black Mirror

8.   Buffy the Vampire Slayer

7.   Firefly

6.   X-Files

5.   The Prisoner

4.   Doctor Who

3.   Battlestar Galactica

2.   The Twilight Zone

1.    Star Trek

I vehemently rail against any list that positions <em>Doctor Who</em> as number four! I have an internal debate between <em>Doctor Who</em> and <em>Star Trek</em> taking the number one slot. So in my world if <em>Doctor Who</em> is not number one, it is only second to <em>Star Trek</em>. But like I said, it's an ongoing internal debate for me.

So what's your opinion about this list? Which science fiction show does it leave out? Which science fiction show do you think is absurd to be on the list? <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/40-best-science-fiction-tv-shows-20160526/firefly-2002-2003-20160525">Go over to RollingStone to see the complete list of 40 shows.</a> I am curious to know what you think!
