It is a new sitcom starring Adam Pally, Leighton Meester, and Yassir Lester. Daniel (Adam Pally) works in a small liberal arts college in Massachusetts.

On his weekends (and sometimes Tuesdays), he goes back to colonial Massachusetts to meet up with his girlfriend Deborah Revere, (Leighton Meester) who is Paul Revere’s daughter. His time machine is a duffel bag. Daniel thinks he might have messed up the start of the American Revolution so he enlists the aid of Chris Parish (Yassir Lester) a history professor at their college to help set it right. The reason for the American Revolution not starting on time; Paul Revere is too upset about his daughter dating Daniel to do his famous ride and warn the American militia that the British are coming. It is a very silly but fun show.

The funniest characters were Deborah and Chris. I will continue watching this show and if you’re interested in some smart, stupid fun, watch it on Sunday nights on Fox.
