<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5002" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/The-Return-of-Doctor-Mysterio-1-250x119.jpg" alt="the-return-of-doctor-mysterio-1" width="250" height="119" />Like in a MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) production we see comic book panels. A grown man in New York City is asleep dreaming of a major event in his childhood. A small child in bed before Christmas is coughing. He hears a noise outside his 60<sup>th</sup> floor window and sees a white haired man dangling upside down outside it. He thinks its Santa, but better yet, it’s the Doctor. The boy lets him in and offers him milk and cookies. While the boy waits for his parents to go back to sleep the Doctor reads a Superman comic book. He’s quite proud to figure out that Clark Kent and Superman are one and the same. He’s deflated to learn everyone knew that. The Doctor points out in his defense that Lois Lane didn’t know and she’s a reporter.

The boy’s name is Grant and he and the doctor are walking up the staircase to the roof discussing Spiderman. When he hears he was bitten by a radioactive spider the Doctor assumes all he got was radiation poisoning. On the roof is the contraption the doctor was building, a time distortion equalizer for the times he’s been in New York and disrupted time; “The Angels Take Manhattan” being the latest. Grant is still coughing so the Doctor takes a glass of water out of his pocket for Grant to drink and hands him a gemstone to hold for him. The Doctor is explaining his time distortion equalizer.

He tells Grant he’s the Doctor; Grant asks which Doctor, the Doctor says he’s the original Doctor; Grant says in the comic books he’d be called Doctor Mysterio. The Doctor asks if he’d like to light up the time distortion equalizer, of course he would. They start pressing buttons and flipping switches and then the Doctor asks Grant for the gemstone to put in the contraption to fire it up. Grant thought it was cold medicine for his cough so he swallowed it. The Doctor is concerned; Grant asks will it hurt him, the Doctor says it’ll do the opposite. Grant starts to float up, the Doctor grabs his legs to bring him back down and tells him it has made him a superhero; as they fly out of the scene. Adult Grant wakes up to comfort a baby. The glow his chest had when he took off with the Doctor years ago is still there.

We zoom in over a building that has a globe over it like the Daily Planet but instead it’s the New York City headquarters for Harmony Shoal, a research institute with branches in all the major world capitals. Its leader, Mr. Brock is holding a press conference. A reporter named Lucy Fletcher asks him about the company’s benefactors, no one knows who they are. Mr. Brock jokes he’s buried them in his Montana sized backyard. He asks are there any more questions, a weird looking bald man asks him where the little boy’s room is. Brock is taken aback and tells him someone can show him where the restrooms are. The bald headed man, Nardole mutters to himself it’d be strange for him to rest in the room. A man with a heavy German accent named Dr. Sim goes up to Mr. Brock. He needs to talk to him in private about an important matter. As they are talking we see Lucy talking to a cleaning lady. Brock tells Sim to meet him at midnight.

[caption id="attachment_5000" align="alignleft" width="250"]<img class="wp-image-5000 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/doctorwhoSushi-250x141.jpeg" alt="doctorwhosushi" width="250" height="141" /> Lucy and the Doctor[/caption]

Dr. Sim and Mr. Brock meet in a vault surrounded by brains. Outside the vault, Lucy is disguised as a cleaning lady listening in on their conversation. Hiding in the shadows is Nardole and he tells someone it’s all clear. Brock tells Sim the benefactors are behind their institute and he doesn’t know what they have planned. Sim tells him more brains have arrived mysteriously. Lucy is listening intently when she realizes someone else has joined her. It’s the Doctor eating sushi. He tells her he likes a snack while doing this sort of thing and for her to continue listening. Sim tells Brock to touch the container of one of the brains. He does it and the brain opens its eyes. He asks what is going on and notices that something is wrong with Sim. His eyes are flashing and a blue fluid is dripping from his eyes. Brock hits him and Sim has to readjust his face. He tells him the same thing that has happened to him is going to happen to Brock. Three men in surgeon gear appear and Sim locks Brock in the vault with them.

[caption id="attachment_5010" align="alignleft" width="250"]<img class="wp-image-5010 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/harmony_shoals-250x141.jpeg" alt="harmony_shoals" width="250" height="141" /> Lucy, The Doctor, and Nardole at Harmony Shoal[/caption]

Running away from the scene is Lucy and the Doctor. He asks her who she is and she tells him she’s a reporter with the Daily Chronicle. She asks who he is and he says he’s Special Agent Dan Danger from Scotland Yard on assignment. Dr. Sim catches them and points a gun at them. Nardole joins in the fun. The Doctor tells a confused Lucy and Nardole to turn their backs on Sim. If he shoots them in the back he’ll have trouble explaining how he shot them in the back while they are on their way to the morgue. They don’t like his plan. All four of them hear tapping from outside the window, but are confused since they are 100 stories up.

[caption id="attachment_4997" align="alignleft" width="250"]<img class="wp-image-4997 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ghost1-250x141.jpeg" alt="ghost1" width="250" height="141" /> Grant as the Ghost[/caption]

They turn around to see a costumed superhero with a big G on his chest floating outside the window. Lucy can’t believe it, it’s the Ghost. He snaps his finger and the window smashes. Dr. Sim is impressed; the windows and building were designed to take up to 4X a nuclear explosion. He unloads his gun but it doesn’t even faze the Ghost. He picks up Sim and tosses him against the wall knocking him out. He knows who Lucy is, he reads her stories in the paper. She is impressed he’s a superhero and a reader. He asks who the other two are. The Doctor introduces Nardole and himself. The Ghost asks which Doctor, the Doctor says the main one. The Ghost nods in recognition and asks Lucy if she’d like a ride. She asks if he has a car, he doesn’t but he swoops her up in his arms and asks if she has a problem with heights. She hasn’t so far, so they take off into the night air. As they fly off the Doctor quietly says “Grant”.

[caption id="attachment_5003" align="alignleft" width="212"]<img class="wp-image-5003 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/grant_baby-212x141.jpeg" alt="grant_baby" width="212" height="141" /> Nardole, Grant, and the baby[/caption]

The Ghost flies Lucy back to her building. A baby monitor goes off and the Ghost flies off to another mission. The mission is getting back to the baby we met earlier in the show. The Ghost does a quick costume change back to dorky Grant; he sees the Doctor holding baby Jennifer, Grant is her nanny. The Doctor scolds Grant for leaving a baby alone. He explains to the Doctor that he has a long range baby monitor and he can get to her faster than a normal person can who is in the same apartment. The Doctor asks him how much more complicated can he make his life; Lucy walks in the room. She is Jennifer’s mother! Grant calls her by her married name Mrs. Lombard. Her husband walked out when Jennifer was born, so she uses her maiden name Fletcher for work.

[caption id="attachment_4998" align="alignleft" width="250"]<img class="wp-image-4998 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/doctor_grant-250x141.jpeg" alt="doctor_grant" width="250" height="141" /> The Doctor and Grant chat on the fire escape[/caption]

The Doctor recognizes the name Lucy and we flashback to Grant’s high school years. The Doctor is masquerading as the substitute algebra teacher to check in on Grant. He thought the gemstone would pass out of Grant along with the superpowers, but instead they’ve become attached to his DNA. The gemstone is called the Hazandra: The Ghost of Love and Wishes. It works like a little computer that can grant a person’s wishes. Young Grant was into superheroes, so it gave him superhero powers. The Doctor is talking to teen Grant but he won’t look at the Doctor or anyone else. The Doctor thinks its shyness, it’s not, Grant is afraid to look at anyone because of his X-ray vision. He can’t control it and he’s in naked hell. Puberty is a bitch. One pretty girl says hi to Grant, it’s teen Lucy. Grant has a crush on her. We go back to present time and Grant tells the Doctor he ran into Lucy years later with his then best friend. Lucy and his buddy quickly fell in love, got married and had a baby. His now ex-friend ran off with another woman and abandoned Lucy and Jennifer. Grant became Jennifer’s nanny.<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The Doctor has a great laugh at this and thanks the universe for having someone worst at romance than him. Grant hears sirens and flies off.</span>

[caption id="attachment_5015" align="alignleft" width="250"]<img class="wp-image-5015 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/huffle2-250x141.jpg" alt="huffle2" width="250" height="141" /> The Doctor, Lucy, and Mr. Huffle[/caption]

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Lucy comes to the fire escape and invites the Doctor in for some questions. She uses a squeeze toy called Mr. Huffle as a lie detector.Every time the Doctor lies, she squeezes Mr. Huffle who gives off an irritating air going out of a balloon noise. After several lies and squeezes, he finally tells her what is going on. The brains are independent alien life forms. They travel the universe taking over host who help them colonize planets. They are on Earth to do the same to us. Lucy believes him. She figures out that the Doctor knows the Ghost and asks him to tell her who he is. The Doctor sees Grant on TV outside a burning building telling people to buy smoke detectors. Grant shows back up and she again asks the Doctor who the Ghost is, the Doctor tells her some secrets are too stupid to keep. Grant gets the hint and goes to the next room and calls Lucy on the phone to set up an interview/date. The scene is handled like a comic book with different panels of Lucy, Grant, the Doctor and baby Jennifer as Lucy and Grant/The Ghost talk. After they set the interview/date, Lucy goes into the kitchen to see if Grant can babysit for her while she goes to her date, she means interview. Grant tells her he has a date. She is surprised and jealous. Grant tells her he’ll break his date so she can go on her interview/date. After Lucy leaves the room the Doctor tells Grant that Lucy was jealous. Grant was too, him jealous of himself and Lucy unknowingly jealous of herself. The Doctor asks Grant how long he’s known her; he says since elementary school, so about 24 years. Hearing 24 years makes the Doctor sad.</span>

Mr. Brock joins Dr. Sim after his operation. They call the human bodies they’ve stolen, vehicles. They begin looking at the videotape of Sim holding the Doctor at gunpoint. They wonder who he is and how much of a threat he is to them when suddenly the tape becomes live and it’s the Doctor talking to them. A very cool effect. He tells them he’s there for mercy, they tell him they don’t give mercy, he tells them he wasn’t asking for mercy, he’s offering it. If they book out, he’ll let them leave. They foolishly don’t accept his offer. They plan on shooting him but the Doctor whistles and Nardole shows up with the Tardis. The Doctor commends him on his driving the Tardis.

[caption id="attachment_5016" align="alignleft" width="250"]<img class="wp-image-5016 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/constintinople-250x134.jpeg" alt="constintinople" width="250" height="134" /> Nardole in Constantinople robes[/caption]

Nardole admits he had a few problems. He’s dressed in 12<sup>th</sup> century Constantinople robes. He ruled Constantinople for a while as a tough but fair leader. They head off for the Harmony Shoals building in Tokyo.
Before the interview/date, Lucy is wearing a plain grey outfit. Grant reminds her when she’s going on a big date she wears a red dress.  She tells him this isn’t a date but work. She leaves and he changes his outfit and becomes the Ghost. He flies off into the air with a fancy picnic basket one has for romantic dates. He flies back to the roof of their building. Lucy comes up wearing a hot short red dress. So I guess it isn’t work unless Lucy has another profession we aren’t aware of.

Dr. Sim and Mr. Brock track down the Ghost. Brock and the surgeons get in an ambulance and head towards Lucy and Grant’s building. The Doctor and Nardole went to Tokyo to follow the signal from Harmony Shoals to their spacecraft. Meanwhile the Ghost and Lucy are having their date. They engage in playful banter in the form of an interview. She asks if he has a girlfriend, pause… a boyfriend. She jokes that people have wondered since he wears a rubber suit and has a big G on his chest.

He playfully chastises people for stereotyping people. He mentions Lucy having a baby. She wonders how he knows that. He tells her he did his research. Lucy tells him she has a nanny who is a man. His response is pretty neutral, but Lucy gets defensive because men like him make fun of a man being a nanny. He tells her he’s like no other man, but she counters there aren’t any men like Grant. She gets up from the table to think. She is beginning to realize she loves Grant.

Back at Tokyo the Doctor has cleared the Harmony Shoal building by having everyone go outside looking for Pokémon Go. They go to a desktop and track the spacecraft. They take the Tardis to the spacecraft. An alarm is triggered alerting Dr. Sim that someone is aboard the spacecraft. Some half headed goons on board the ship look for the Doctor and Nardole. Our heroes notice that the reactor core is rigged to split. The ship is now a bomb. The Doctor starts to figure out the villains’ plan. Sim appears on screen to tell them they are too late. The Doctor asks why they haven’t crashed the spacecraft yet, Sim says it’s not time yet. Their plan is to crash the spacecraft on New York, destroying everything there but the Harmony Shoal building. If you remember the building is designed to withstand 4X a nuclear attack. In a panic the world leaders would go to the Harmony Shoal buildings in their capitals to hide from an alien invasion. Instead of being safe, their brains will be replaced by the alien brains. The Doctor thinks it’s a brilliant plan. The Earth has a plan too, Sim asks what it is; the Doctor says our plan is him. He proceeds to hit buttons to make the spacecraft crash right away.

[caption id="attachment_5005" align="alignleft" width="248"]<img class="wp-image-5005 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ghost_lucy-248x141.jpeg" alt="ghost_lucy" width="248" height="141" /> Lucy and the Ghost[/caption]

Lucy is telling the Ghost about Grant. He removes his mask to tell her he is Grant but she starts telling him how Grant has never lied to her so he puts his mask back on before she notices. Mr. Brock and his surgeons appear; they plan on inserting an alien brain in the Ghost. He threatens Lucy with the gun he pulled from his head. The Ghost flies off; Brock then threatens the baby, but the Ghost returns as Grant and tells him that no one will harm the baby with him around.

The Doctor’s first plan was to use the Tardis to get rid of the crashing spacecraft, he can’t get to it due to the half headed aliens aboard, so he uses a frequency only Grant can hear and tells Grant the spacecraft is headed his way and he is the only person in the world who can stop it. Grant takes off his glasses and tells Lucy to get down and he catches the spacecraft with one hand. He has an embarrassed look on his face since Lucy now knows he is the Ghost. The Tardis appears on the roof top and the Doctor and Nardole exit it.

[caption id="attachment_5022" align="alignleft" width="250"]<img class="wp-image-5022 size-thumbnail" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/grant-stops-250x128.jpg" alt="grant-stops" width="250" height="128" /> Lucy and Grant[/caption]

Lucy is right next to Grant and they look ready to kiss. The Doctor tells Grant before they get too excited he should get rid of the bomb. Lucy tells him she likes him better with his superhero costume on so she puts his glasses back on him. They kiss and start floating up into the sky. Mr. Brock points his gun at the Doctor and tells him this isn’t over; the Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to disable the gun and tells him it is. At a distance we can see a helicopter from UNIT headed to the Harmony Shoals building to shut it down. We see the UNIT team rounding up people. Dr. Sim’s alien brain has left his body and I think taken a UNIT soldier’s body. I guess this could be continued next season.

Sometime later, we’re back in Lucy’s apartment. She and Grant are cuddled together. Grant says he’s through being the Ghost. Lucy asks if he’s sure. He thinks he’ll keep the suit in case the world needs him. The Doctor tells him not to worry about it, he’s back now and he’ll take care of all the major threats. Grant asks where has he been, Lucy thinks the better question is what’s her name? The Doctor tries to back out but he finally says, “Things end. That’s all. Everything ends and it’s always sad. But everything begins again too, and that’s always happy.” After the Doctor leaves; Nardole tells them about the Doctor and River Song. How they were together for 24 years and she died. They are concerned for the Doctor but Nardole tells them, “He’s very brave and very silly and for a while he’ll be sad.” Nardole will look after him. After Nardole leaves, Lucy asks Grant who is the Doctor. Grant tells her he’s Doctor Mysterio.

This is the first episode we’ve gotten since the last Christmas special. That is a whole year of no new Doctor Who episodes. So like everyone else I was ready for this one. My initial impression was it was a pleasant, light episode. Not the worst episode of Doctor Who I’ve seen, but not that great. I watched it a second time and really grew to appreciate it. The part I wasn’t that crazy about, Grant and Lucy really grew on me. The actors, Justin Chatwin and Charity Wakefield were very cute together. You hoped Grant and Lucy would get together.

I enjoyed their playful banter on their date/interview. I found Grant more charming the second time around. I would tell Moffat to leave the super heroics to the CW, they are pretty good at it. Still the superhero part of the story was lighthearted and didn’t take itself too seriously. I’d advise some DC movies to do the same. What I liked the best the first time I saw the episode and the second time was the Doctor, (of course). He was in great form being brave, silly and a little sad. I enjoyed his chemistry with Nardole. Matt Lucas seems like another fine addition to the Doctor Who family. I liked Nardole a lot better this time as the Doctor’s sidekick than as River’s. Maybe the Doctor adjusted his head right after reattaching it. The villains were okay, they weren’t too big of a threat but they kept the story moving. Something I later found out, the villains are connected to the villains in “The Husbands of River Song”. Harmony Shoals is the same organization that was involved in that story, the Shoal of the Winter Harmony. So it looks like they made it to Earth. Doctor Who will return in April and I’ll be writing about it when it returns. It is Moffat’s final season, I hope it’s not Peter Capaldi’s. I enjoy his Doctor more and more each time I see him. I love the gleeful madness he brings to his Doctor. I’ll be writing about Moffat’s other show next week, Sherlock. Depending on my hangover from ringing in the New Year, I’ll have it out as soon as possible. Happy New Year!!
