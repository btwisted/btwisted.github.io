<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5451" src="http://nayahsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/young-pope-250x109.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="109" />Did you catch <strong>The Young Pope</strong> on HBO Sunday and Monday night? It stars Jude Law as a 40ish American Cardinal named Lenny Belardo who is named the new Pope. He takes the name Pope Pius XIII. No one really knows who he is or what he stands for. It appears that Cardinal Voiello (Silvio Orlando) might have helped this unknown become Pope so he could have a puppet. Instead of helping to install a puppet, he might have installed a madman. Lenny is a conservative theologian who might take the Catholic Church back to the middle ages. It’s a fun character study of an egotistical outsider who plans on shaking up the status quo. The question is if he is going to shake things up or destroy it. For the first two episodes we get to enjoy everyone around him being completely taken aback. Everyone is talking about it as a take on the new Trump era. The political maneuvering in the Vatican is fun, but what carries the show so far is the performance of Jude Law and his outfits. You’ve probably seen the memes of the show and a lot of it centers on his papal outfits. His clothing game is on point. Most of the memes just enjoy the premise of a young pope. Once you watch the show, you’ll see it’s a dark comedy exploring religious belief in a respectful manner. The people who exhibit true faith aren’t mocked for it. The high-ranking church officials who are only playing the game are shown in less than a flattering light. There are 10 episodes and HBO is showing two a week, on Sundays and Mondays. I would recommend the next show HBO do is the <strong>Old Alter Boy</strong>. Think about the memes it would generate.

I didn’t watch a lot of TV shows this week. Aside from <strong>The Young Pope</strong> and <strong>Sherlock</strong>, the only show I watched that wasn’t sports related or the news was Black-ish. I especially enjoyed the episode from last week, “Lemons”. It’s about the aftermath of Trump’s election and how everyone is handling it, or not handling it. It was a very smart episode that didn’t forget to be funny. No matter on what side of the political divide you are on, this hasn’t been the normal transition. I won’t get too political right now, because if I start, I might go on a 30 page rant. No one wants that. The Johnson family is freaking out, but they have each other and they know they’ll get through this. I don’t have the Johnson’s, but I do have my own family and friends, and I know I’ll be getting through it too.

Many of the shows I regularly watch are coming back next week, so I’ll discuss some of them. Until then, have a great week.
