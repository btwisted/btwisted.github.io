<p id="continue-jump">In the dystopian city of Nicque, a decade-long energy drought has caused mass poverty and famine and the people are ready to revolt.  Violence ensues and dissenters are wrongfully imprisoned.  You are a member of a secret society rebellion and are gifted a magical bracelet which helps you on your quest to free your imprisoned truelove.  Choose your path, solve mini-games, and use your Carpulest bracelet to unlock new magical elements and spells throughout your reading journey.  But the clock is ticking – and you only have until sunrise to stage a jailbreak or else the love of your life is gone for good.</p>
Recipient of the prestigious Canada Media Fund award, The Mighty Maru is a visual novel specifically designed for The Nex Band.  In fact, the very idea of the band started as a prop in this magical adventure created by the multiple Emmy-Award winning co-founders.  "Nex was born out of a creative story world which is what makes it unique in wearables" explains Mighty Cast CEO, <span class="xn-person">Adam Adelman</span>.  "We wanted to share this experience with our community and allow it to be played for free whether you have a Nex Band or not".

The Mighty Maru is a free to play visual novel and available now at the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
