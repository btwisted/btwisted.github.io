<p dir="ltr">Nayah Solutions is excited to announce the kickoff of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/androidcampsuza">SUZA Android Camp</a>, an organization created and managed by computer science students at The State University of Zanzibar (SUZA). Students designed the organization to motivate students to develop applications for the Android operating system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SUZA Android Camp builds on the information that Google software engineer, Thiago Santos, delivered during the <em>Introduction to Android</em> workshop sponsored by Nayah Solutions, May 27-30, 2013. The students plan to create applications that compete in the market and uplift the local community. For example, the Department of Kiswahili for Foreigners at the university has requested the SUZA Android Camp to create an application that teaches Kiswahili. Students are now developing the application.</p>
Nayah Solutions is also pleased to report that the university is in the final planning phase of creating an Android introductory course for continuing education. Â This course also builds on the <em>Introduction to Android</em> workshop sponsored by Nayah Solutions. Continuing education students who successfully complete this course will be eligible to join the SUZA Android Camp.
