I traveled to Dar es Salaam for the first time. The contrast between Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar is like night (usiku) and day (siku).  Dar es Salaam is a modern African city. As a westerner, I felt incredibly comfortable because people dress the way they want. It has a distinct African character of course, but more modern--traffic lights, skyscrapers, more English speakers, better access to western creature comforts and so on. Zanzibar, as I have mentioned, is a walk back into the 10th century in some ways. Not a criticism--just an observation.

I went to Dar es Salaam for an MRI. I've had neck and shoulder problems for quite awhile. But traveling  to Zanzibar in economy class and picking up heavy luggage exacerbated the problem. I decided to go to <a href="http://www.agakhanhospitals.org/dar/index.asp">Aga Khan hospital</a>. Aga Khan hospitals are located throughout Africa and India. The hospital chain has a reputation of being one of the best. I am glad there is an Aga Khan hospital close to me. Getting to Dar es Salaam is a two-hour ferry ride and about a 30 minute plane ride.

My landlord's 17 year old daughter, Sabbah, kindly accompanied me to Dar es Salaam. She was very helpful as a Swahilli interpreter (although many  people in Dar es Salaam speak English) and a caretaker when my shoulder couldn't lift my bag.

To get a cheaper, non-tourist rate on the ferry I covered my head so I could look Zanzibari. What do you think? I think I blend in well. If it weren't so hot and humid all the time, I would cover more. When we arrived in Dar es Salaam I removed the scarf. Too hot!

The doctor was very professional and I felt confident with his diagnosis. The only negative experience was with the billing department verifying my international medical coverage. But that kind of bureaucratic inconvenience can happen anywhere, and the matter was eventually resolved.

The doctor would not be available again until the next morning to evaluate the MRI results. So Sabbah and  I spent the night at a nice hotel. Zanzibar has kind and wonderful people, but it's third world. Life is not very convenient for a westerner. So the hotel and its amenities really recharged my batteries.

This trip, for the most part, was uneventful. After all it was only a trip to the doctor. After concluding my visit with the doctor, we headed back to Zanzibar.

I plan to visit Dar es Salaam at least once a month to really get to know the city. (I've been warned it can be dangerous like many big cities, so I'll be careful)

To end this post, a few questions emerged from the trip: Why is Zanibar so far behind when it's so close to Dar es Salaam? Zanzibar is a tourist attraction and has lots of natural resources. Why is there not more development from the Tanzanian government? I have heard some Zanzibari residents complain about neglect from the mainland. After my trip I have a better understanding of their perspective.

Below are some random shots of our trip. Until the next time . . . .
