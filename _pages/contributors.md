Nichols</a> </span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><em>(Principal Contributor)</em> </span>is a fan, enthusiast, and appreciator of sci-fi, comic books, and fantasy film and TV. As an everyman I enjoy watching and dissecting the work these creative men and women have birthed. Unfortunately I don’t have the ability to create their <em>fantastical</em> worlds, but I can celebrate their achievements and share them with others. When I’m not enjoying others works, I earn a living working in higher education in the badlands known as Texas. If you would like to discuss anything I’ve written or hip me to something you think is worthwhile, contact me at <span style="color: #993366;"><span style="color: #800080;"><em><strong><span style="color: #800080;"><a style="color: #800080;" href="mailto:kbeartv61@nayahscifi.com">kbeartv61@nayahscifi.com</a></span>.</strong></em></span></span> Thanks for visiting our site.
