Nayah Sci Fi believes that science fiction is a fun way for students to learn STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).

Many professionals attribute their love of science fiction as a great influence in their career choices.
They fondly remember books or movies they consumed as children as a catalyst to investigate and research scientific concepts, without the prodding of a teacher or parent. Science fiction has sparked the imagination of artists and writers to explore and share their vision of a superhero or dystopian society.

We'll provide insights and activities in science fiction, which we hope fuels the current and next generation of learners to use their imagination and learn about anything they want. 

We are Nayah Sci Fi. 
The future belongs to us all!
